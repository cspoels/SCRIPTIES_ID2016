<h1>
	00 – INTRODUCTION
</h1>

<p>
	Speculative Design is a contemporary design method that poses questions about current and emerging technologies using the design medium in a futuristic sense. By employing a technology in a futuristic sense, contextualizing it in fiction, the design provides grip on the technology in its current state. By posing “what ifs?”, a discussion opens up on the desirability of such futures, and what it requires from the present to prevent or facilitate them.
</p>

<p>
	<cite src="http://www.dynamicgenetics.co.uk">Dynamic Genetics vs. Mann</cite> by Superflux<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> serves as a good example of this design method. Dynamic Genetics vs. Mann is a collection of evidence in a fictional and speculated court case. The premise is set in a not to distant future, where private genetic therapy can, due to technological advancements in bioengineering, severely reduces health risks. Privatization in the health sector (which is occurring, non-fictionally, currently in Britain) increased the prices for genetic therapy drastically. When the protagonist, Arnold Mann, is diagnosed with a health risk, he is caught between the increased premium of his health insurance and the expensive gene therapy by private cooperation’s. 
	Through a range of objects and media such as photographs, artifacts, documents and video footage the audience is asked to explore the politics of power and control. 
</p>

<p>
	By exposing the audience to this fictional world that is derived of current politics the audience is asked: what is desirable? Advancements in bioengineering might provide us with better health but in exchange for increased control of the manufacturers. What does it require of the present to facilitate or prevent this future? Is halting privatization of the health sector enough? Does halting it prevent the advancement of gene therapy?

<p>
	The goal of a speculative design is to generate critical questions in the audience.
</p>

<p>
	The speculative method of envisioning the future has a pitfall though. When creating a fictional world, immersing a viewer becomes that much more important. To make a Speculative Design future justifiable a viewer needs to believe it. The fantasy does not become relevant until it has a clear origin in the present, making the fantastical scenario possible and conceivable. When it is not, or structured poorly, the design becomes extreme, far fetched. While the technology envisioned in the Speculative Design might be possible, the lack of causality and clear structure makes it undemanding for the viewer to detach him- or herself from the design and to disassociate him- or herself from the problem.
</p>

<p>
	When utilizing a futuristic perspective as in Speculative Design, what narrative structure does it require for a designer to provide the viewer with an understanding of a plausible future conflict while ensuring that the extremity of the futuristic perspective does not enable detachment between the viewer and the design? 
</p>

<h2>
	PRESENT FUTURES 
</h2>

<p>
	Though quite a few Speculative Designs present us with futures that are believable, I often find the narrative structure used within these designs as incomplete and skewed. I will discuss these narrative structures in depth in this thesis, juxtaposed against narrative structures of other storytelling mechanisms such as fables and myths. Fables and myths have a very similar function to Speculative Design: to educate its audience of unfavorable consequences of actions. 
</p>

<p>
	The narrative structure of fables and myths however is vastly more mature and easier to understand then that of Speculative Design. Fables and myths utilize a linear structure to explain causality. This causality is lacking, or at the very least, harder to find in Speculative Design. Positioning the narrative structure of Speculative Design next to that of fables and myths make clear this deficiency of causality in Speculative Design create an absence of clarity. 
</p>

<p>
	Through speculation you are forced to think about the present as the speculative problem is derived of present events. Dr. Joseph Voros, a PhD in theoretical physics and professional futurist wrote a brief introduction to futuristic possibilities in the article <i>A Primer on Futuristic Studies, Foresight and the Use of Scenarios</i>.
</p>

<blockquote cite="Dr. Joseph Voros, ‘A Primer on Futuristic Studies, Foresight and the Use of Scenarios’, Prospect, 2001">
	"The actual future (singular) which eventuates, and in which we will ultimately live and experience as "the present" at that time, will be governed by our actions (or inaction) in this present, along with the choices we have made among many alternative potential futures (plural). Our choices and the passage of time reduce the infinite field of potentialities to a single experienced actuality, which then passes into history and cannot be changed. In other words, and this is the key point, we can only have an influence on the potentialities of the "yet to be" and can do nothing about the "what has already been". Therefore, let us try to create a better present moment (and thus past history), by choosing more wisely and responsibility among out potential alternative futures.” <sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Speculative Design searches for plausible futures, something that could happen and stems from our current scientific, cultural and/or political knowledge. The plausible is embedded into the possible, whereas the plausible is more believable. As Dr. Joseph Voser explains:
</p>

<blockquote src="Dr. Joseph Voros, ‘A Primer on Futuristic Studies, Foresight and the Use of Scenarios’, Prospect, 2001.">
	“<b>Possible futures.</b> This class of futures includes all the kinds of futures we can possibly imagine - those which "might happen" - no matter how far-fetched, unlikely or "way out". They might, as a result, involve knowledge which we do not yet possess (the "warp drive" of Star Trek is a good example), or might also involve transgressions of currently-accepted physical laws or principles. I tend to characterise these futures as being reliant on the existence of some future knowledge (i.e. knowledge we do not yet possess) in order to come about. 
	[…]
	<b>Plausible futures.</b> This class encompasses those futures which "could happen" (i.e. they are not excluded) according to our current knowledge (as opposed to future knowledge) of how things work. They stem from our current understanding of physical laws, processes, causation, systems of human interaction, etc. This is clearly a smaller subset of futures than the possible.” <sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	By imagining wild non-plausible scenarios it has the possibility of degrading into fantasy. Thus, to envision something plausible you have to incorporate the present, or at the very least, current knowledge. 
</p>

<img src="img/Bob Segers.jpg" />

<p>
	By extrapolating the present into an undesirable future you become aware of present issues that need to be addressed to prevent this unwanted future. Speculative Design uses this cautionary method in objects, installations, books and films. It provides a glimpse of the future through the design. The object functions as a future artifact, almost as proof of its plausibility. When the design is presented in a physical form this becomes even clearer, especially when it has a working and existent form in the present. <i>After Life Euthanasia Device</i> <sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> by Dunne & Raby is a work that employs such physicality. <i>After Life Euthanasia Device</i> uses a battery, <i>Afterlife</i>, fabricated by designers James Auger and Jimmy Loizeau. This battery is charged through a deceased person biomaterial to create a chemical reaction that provides power for the battery. Dunne & Raby made a device that a widowed person could use to end their own life, using the afterlife power of their deceased loved ones. The device is a carbon dioxide dispenser that is power by the Afterlife battery that will assist their left behind loved one to join him or her in the afterlife (afterlife being a battery or otherwise).
</p>

<p>
	All the components – the euthanasia device, the battery, the carbon dioxide – function. It is however not fabricated for commercial appliance, but to question our believes of afterlife. The physical fabrication is in ways a sort of proof of plausibility.
</p>

<img src="img/Still Life Euthanasia Device by Dunne & Raby.jpg" />

<p>
	When confronted with the designed object the viewer is presented with a problem. Rarely does Speculative Design pose a desirable future. It mostly serves as a warning mechanism. Take for instance <i>Dynamic Genetics vs. Mann</i>: be wary of the control genetic therapy clinics can exert on the public when given free reign. <i>After Life Euthanasia Device</i> also questions the desirability of technological achievements. Should a person be able to persist after death? What influence can the entity exert on loved ones left behind? Is it desirable? The design confronts the viewer with a conflict, an issue or an unwelcome effect of current affairs. 
</p>

<p>
	The product of the designer is shown in isolation, as if brought from some foreign place, ripped from its environment. The future that the design inhabits is not there yet, but the product is here now, functioning in its entire splendor and warning us of its functions, safely in our comfortable present. 
</p>

<h2>
	FABLE
</h2>

<p>
	While Speculative Design is a fairly new method of cautionary communication, it is certainly not the first. The fable or myth has filled a similar role in the past. 
	While the fable does not use a futuristic perspective, it does warn its reader or listener in a similar fashion: presenting harmful effects of actions. 
</p>

<p>
	The fable for example tells a story of morality: be fair, be just, be ethical, or face the consequences. The fable often speaks of wrongful actions of characters that are sequentially punished for these actions or meet some kind of unfortunate fate. As a result, the reader or listener is warned not to behave in a similar fashion, as he or she might undergo the same fate. For example in Red Riding Hood, you are warned not to stray from the path or harm will befall you from forest animals. 
</p>

<h2>
	THREE-ACT STRUCTURE 
</h2>

<p>
	Fables, myths and folklores like these are nearly all structured in the same way. Screenwriter Christopher Vogler explains this structure in his book <cite src="Christopher Vogler, The Writer’s Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers, Michael Wiese Productions, 1992">The Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers</cite><sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> which mentions the three-act structure. It is a structure still found in many films and books and is prevalent in how we think about traditional storytelling. The structure describes the story in three acts: the setup, the confrontation and the resolution. 
</p>

<p>
	The setup provides an understanding of the world the story is situated in and provides background of characters. The confrontation act starts when the protagonist of the story is faced with the issue the story will resolve around. The resolution is how the conflict or confrontation will be resolved: how, or if, it will be overcome. 
</p>

<p>
	Nearly all fables and myths fit perfectly inside this structure, and most present-day stories still do. This structure is greatly suited for fiction and non-fiction alike, as the linearity of this narrative provides great insight into causality. One event causes the next, which in return causes the next event, etc. This structure provides clarity as the chronological order of events teaches us that actions have clear consequences. When having heard the story of Red Riding Hood, you know the cause of the initial conflict was straying of the woodland path, and so the listener is taught not to do so if he or she wants to keep safe. 
</p>

<h2>
	LINEARITY OF THE FUTURE 
</h2>

<p>
	I will use the three-act structure to analyze the narrative structure of Speculative Design in order to pinpoint the main problem, in my opinion, of cautionary future fictions. In most cases, a Speculative Design poses just the confrontation act. The setup act is actually our present, our everyday surroundings. The goal of a Speculative Design is for the viewer to reach an introvert resolution. This resolution is, however, an alternative setup, a shift in our present. Because the conflict that the design presents is a futuristic one, we can be ahead of it. By not creating the cause of the conflict, we resolve it. 
</p>

<p>
	It is clear then that in a Speculative Design the centerpiece might be the object, artifact and conflict, the actual concept of the work is that of the present that is being proposed twice. One that enables the conflict, and one that does not. 
</p>

<p>
	I find that in most Speculative Designs this present is given very little substance, for instance only a few lines of text, leaving it up to the viewer to fill in the blanks. The viewer is also left to fabricate his own resolution, and so it becomes abundantly clear what Speculative Design is lacking: context. 
</p>

<h2>
	PROPOSAL 
</h2>

<p>
	In this thesis I will propose methods of achieving narrative structure that compose causality in a non-linear way. Structures that present causes not as clearly as a linear narrative, but one that enables a firmer grip on speculative futures through a narrative that determines the context of the Speculative Design’s object or installation. 	
</p>


<h1>
	01 - What is the function of a Speculative Design?
</h1>

<p>
	A Speculative Design always starts with a question. More often than not it is a “What if…?”. Not accidentally, “What if…” was the title of the Dutch Design Week in 2015, a yearly design event showcasing current design from Dutch designers. The press release states: 
</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.ddw.nl/pers/dutch-design-week-maakt-thema-2015-bekend-what-if Accessed 22 November 2015">
	“DDW [Dutch Design Week] sees ‘What if...’ as the ultimate question from which creativity and innovation starts. Designers realize the most varied forms of innovation by looking at what exists from a different angle, by not being satisfied with the status quo, and by continuing to look for alternative answers and solutions.
	Martijn Paulen, DDW director: ‘posing the right questions is the motor for the imagination. Designers think about how we will live and live together in the future. They dare to question everything, dream of a different answer and shape it. This is how they lay the basis for the innovations of the future’.” <sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Through asking questions on the now, the hope is to facilitate a better perspective on the future. By being critical towards the present, a designer is able to formulate a perspective on the future. According to the Dutch Design Week’s management, the designer is uniquely positioned to bring this future into reality because of their imagination. 
</p>


<p>
	A Speculative Design is constructed in such a fashion. The designer theorizes a possible future based on the present. The designer transports the future into the present by making it a ‘reality’. It is however not a reality (yet), but a representation of a possible reality. When a design is engaging and interpretable, it forces the viewer, or user, of the design to fantasize its future into subconscious reality. In literature and films, the persuasiveness of fiction is a growing field of study, but its effects are definitely quantifiable as potent. As Markus Appel and Tobias Richter conclude in their article 'Narrative Persuasion and Need for Affect':
</p>

<blockquote cite="Markus Appel & Tobias Richter, ‘Narrative Persuasion and Need for Affect’, Media Psychology, 2010">
	“Our results suggest that persuasive attempts through pathos may have a more pervasive impact than previously conceded.” <sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Melanie C. Green and Timothy C. Brock also studied these transformational effects and power over belief changes and published their findings in the article 'The Role of Transportation in the Persuasiveness of Public Narrative' where they found that a narrative is able to strengthen or weaken beliefs in an audience:
</p>

<blockquote cite"">
	“The Experiment 3 results were consistent with the hypothesis that transportation would influence the effect of narratives on beliefs about violence, psychiatric patients' freedom (albeit unreliably), whether the world is just, and whether crime pays. Although the direction of causality cannot be established by correlational results, both closely related items and more distant beliefs were related to extent of transportation. Transportation was also correlated with the evaluation of characters: Individuals who were highly transported into "Murder at the Mall" showed more positive evaluations of both Katie, the murder victim, and Joan (John), her older sibling. Neither framing the story (as fiction or as dream) nor motivating instructions (theatre performance) systematically moderated the effect of transportation on beliefs. Once again, fiction was as effective as fact in influencing most story-related beliefs (although again, a number of participants had difficulty recalling source information, despite its repeated presentation). As a caveat, the story used here was based on a true story, and thus may have had realistic tones that caused it to have a high impact on the reader. Of course, naturally encountered narrative fiction often exploits realistic and graphic description. Narrative has the power to produce change in its audience. As such we can state that a futuristic narrative can form a belief of its described future, as long as the narrative has transportive potential.” <sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Or as Micheal Solona, an American science fiction writer explains in his article Stop Writing Dystopian Sci-Fi, It Is Making Us Fear the Technology when we are confronted enough with a fiction, the hope or fear of it becoming true increases:
</p>

<blockquote src="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/stop-writing-dystopian-sci-fiits-making-us-all-fear-technology/ accessed 22 November 2015">
	“The very real danger here is man’s tendency to look to his illusion for inspiration, which is the foundation upon which we build society.”
</blockquote>

<p>
	When confronted enough with a fiction, the fear or hope of the fantasy becoming true increases. 
</p>

<p>
	However, the role of a Speculative Design is not to envision a (un)preferred future, but to understand the capabilities of our present. A fantastical future is solely a method to create an alternate perspective on the present. In other words, to create new means of looking at our present. What does the present need to be, or do, to ensure a specific future from happening? If the speculated future is the reaction of a cause in the present, what is that cause? It is much like a mathematical equation where the answer (the speculated future) is known, but the variables (the cause of the future, the cause that happens in this present) are not. To study and reflect on the variable is the actual goal of a Speculative Design. 
</p>


<h1>
	02 - How does a Speculative Design tell?
</h1>

<p>
	The medium of a Speculative Design is not set, but generally exists of a physical object. While a science fiction film can be seen as a Speculative Design, it is rarely so. A Speculative Design prides itself on its physical ability, the power to be actually true in the present as a sort of archeological artifact of the future. 
</p>

<p>
	This physical presence is the strength of a Speculative Design; it is not mere fantasy. A physical object has real implications for the design; it must be able to exist, able to be fabricated with current tools and programs. With it being physical, the designer is withheld from slipping into purely imaginative scenarios. It also provides an argument for the plausibility of the design becoming real or being integrated in everyday life. The physical provides realism. 
</p>

<h2>
	SPECULATIVE ARCHEOLOGY
</h2>

<p>
	I like to describe Speculative Design as an archeological view on design. As I have described in the previous paragraph, the physicality of a Speculative Design – the construction of objects – provides realism. In the sense of Physical Realism<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>, the constructed object is naturally real. However, the object’s purpose is not to prove its own realism, but that of the speculative fictional future world it came from. 
</p>

<p>
	An archeologist recovers, studies and interprets the material culture of historical societies to reach a better understanding of the society that made and used these objects<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>.  In this perspective, archeology is an anthropological discipline. Archeology becomes a method of describing culture through physicality. 
</p>

<p>
	Even when describing a historical culture or society through authentic artifacts, one has to speculate. One has to philosophize about how a culture or society was structured around the artifact, how the artifact was embedded. The ancient properties of an artifact might be irrefutable and maybe its uses and method of production are known, but the effects of such objects on its embodied society  might not be, or vice versa. History is, in fact, not a fact, but an interpretation of evidential artifacts<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>. 
</p>

<p>
	I propose that a Speculative Design should be viewed as an archeological artifact, however not a historical one. Similar to an archeological artifact, in a Speculative Design the object is a clue, a fragment of knowledge, to understand its world, albeit a fictional future instead of history. Through the confrontation of the artifact, we are teased into internally analyzing the embodiment of the design: the fictional world. 
</p>

<h1>
	03 - How does a fable warn?
</h1>

<p>
	The following passage is taken from the dystopian masterpiece <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> by George Orwell that describes a moment where the protagonist of the fictional story is thinking about the amount of control the Party has over history and memory.
</p>

<blockquote cite="George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four, London, 1991, p. 763.">
	“The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed – if all records told the same tale – then the lie passed into history and became truth. ‘Who controls the past’, ran the Party slogan, ‘controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.’ And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. ‘Reality control’, they called it: in Newspeak, ‘doublethink.’” <sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The protagonist understands, like the slogan proclaims, that history is an essential part on how we decide on anything.
</p>

<p>
	Man learns through experience. By experiencing an occurrence we are informed to some degree about circumstances of such an occurrence. When similar circumstances occur again later, we can recognize it through our experience and thus can prepare ourselves for the occurrence of an event. Being able to recognize the cause of a reaction ensures (to some degree) an ability to act on this cause, to prevent or facilitate the reaction. Learning from our past (the cause) ensures our future (the reaction) is a bit more predictable through this recognizable sequence of events.
</p>

<p>
	Often a dangerous situation is prevented using this method. Only after a manifestation of an undesirable situation is a system put in place that prevents the situation from transpiring, or at the very least, lets it happen less often. Such a system could be something physical such as intensified security measures after the 9/11 terrorist attack. Or it could be more intangible such as the fear of getting hurt after experiencing pain. 
</p>

<p>
	In essence, an understanding of history: the causality of events, leads to experience. Experience leads to predictability. 
</p>

<h2>
	MORALITY
</h2>

<p>
	Speculative Design is a medium to educate its viewers, in my opinion, especially on morality. 
	One of the earliest examples of educational narrative on morality is that of a fable. A story is crafted - designed - around (divine) punishment of bad or unwanted morals. 
</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.read.gov/aesop/049.html accessed 22 November 2015">
	“A Wolf left his lair one evening in fine spirits and an excellent appetite. As he ran, the setting sun cast his shadow far out on the ground, and it looked as if the wolf were a hundred times bigger than he really was.
"Why," exclaimed the Wolf proudly, "see how big I am! Fancy me running away from a puny Lion! I'll show him who is fit to be king, he or I."
Just then an immense shadow blotted him out entirely, and the next instant a Lion struck him down with a single blow.“ <sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	By listening to the story, you are taught that the way you view the world has impact how you act. How you act affects what might happen to you. Take the story of <i>The Wolf & His Shadow</i> quoted above. The wolf, through seeing his own big shadow, sees the world as harmless, as he appears so powerful that he can defeat the mightiest creature he encounters. He sees the world as conquerable. This view makes him act bold and reckless. He is not cautionary over his surroundings. The wolf is, however brazen, defeated by the much stronger and fiercer lion. The fable teaches the morality of arrogance. The story instructs its readers, to not think too much of yourself, or you might bite of more than you can chew (in this fable the ‘bite’ will actually chew on you). 
</p>

<p>
	Like a Speculative Design, the fable tries to warn you. To protect yourself from negative outcomes of actions you might or might not perform. It does not do this by outright telling you what not to do. They do however construct scenarios that showcase an outcome of an action. The morality itself is actually embedded in the scenario. As a reader or viewer you have to understand the causality of actions to understand the effect morals might have. The author merely provides a perspective on a specific scenario. It is this perspective that hopefully initiates an insight into the effects of morals.
</p>

<h2>
	A PLAUSIBLE CONFLICT
</h2>

<p>
	The fable instructs the listener or reader to adhere to a certain moral standard to protect him or herself. Speculative Design has in my opinion a similar goal. Through the speculative scenario a world is sketched that might seem frightful. At the very least, a Speculative Design should create some kind of inner conflict; the technology presented in the design has both positive and negative consequences or uses. The design must have some sort of unnerving aspect or quality for it to be able to cause this conflict. The creation of conflict gives cause for self-reflection. 
</p>

<img src="img/Rusty Knives by Revital Cohen & Tuur van Balen.jpg" />

<p>
	Take for instance Rusty Knives<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> by designer duo Revital Cohen & Tuur van Balen. They have created an installation that infuses raspberry plants with a fear hormone, the same hormones that are released by animals that are about to be slaughtered and cause the color and taste of the meat to change. Through this installation the duo tries to distill the taste of violence. This Speculative Design tries to cause a conflict on the uses of genetic alteration in our food. If the fear hormone makes food taste worse, could a happy hormone make it taste better? Would the animals to be slaughtered then, instead of being treated better, be treated with hormone therapy to provide the public with high quality meat? Where in hormone therapy of living animals and plants do we encounter their emotion? Does it matter? 
</p>

<p>
	Hormone therapy has evidential positive uses. For instance, it can correct growth failure and normalize height in infants and toddlers with Turner Syndrome<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> and prevent acute adrenal crisis through the administration of corticosteroids for those suffering from Addison disease<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup>. The hormones used to better the quality of life for humans (physical healthiness) can also be used on cattle to make their meat taste better (commercial). <i>Rusty Knives</i> puts forward the dark side hormone therapy can shape into. The conflict is born from its positive and negative outcomes of hormone therapy, how do you enable the positive application while hindering the negative?  
</p>

<h2>
	A PLAUSIBLE WARNING
</h2>

<p>
	In essence, a Speculate Design acts as some kind of warning. By placing an existing technology in a futuristic and discomforting position, you are warned; be careful, maybe the technology isn’t displeasing now, but it could very well be in the future. 
</p>

<p>
	I would like to emphasize that a Speculative Design does not, in my understanding, inspire fear of a technological thing itself, but instead how it used. Nick Bostrom, an Oxford philosopher, published the book <i>Superintelligence, Paths, Dangers, Strategies</i><sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>  in which he explained the now famous Paperclip Maximizer thought experiment that I will use to illustrate my point. 
</p>

<p>
	The experiment takes a machine, a paperclip-making machine, that is equipped with Artificial Intelligence. The goal of the machine is to make paperclips, as much as possible, as efficient as possible, as fast as possible. The machine, being highly intelligent, would soon discover it could not only use the provided materials to make paperclips, but the whole earth is filled with materials that could be used. Even humans are made out of atoms that could be turned into paperclips. It would fill the world and eventually the galaxy with paperclip making factories to increase the fabrication speed of paperclips until nothing is left except a paperclip utopia.
</p>

<p>
	The thought experiment is meant to alarm about the dangers of how an Artificial Intelligence is programmed, what it’s conditions are, how it might or might not think with human morals. The experiment is not meant to scare you of machines, or paperclips, or Artificial Intelligence, but rather I the method of implementation and the intention of technology. 
</p>


<p>
	A Speculative Design functions in a similar way. It does not warn about the dangers of the technology as a whole, but how it functions, how it is used and implemented. 
</p>

<h1>
	04 - How does a fable tell?
</h1>

<p>
	The construction of the fable is so wonderfully simplistic in appearance and form, and in it, so beautiful. The story progresses linearly, it has a clear start, from which a course of actions is performed by the character(s) of the story. Those actions have a consequence: a reaction. This reaction is the cause of another consequence: a reaction. This causal course continues until the story is concluded with a final consequence. It is such a basic construction, the course of events are recalled in the chronological order of which they have happened. This structure is what makes the causes of actions so understandable, as they happen right after one another. 
</p>

<p>
	Most stories are built in such a fashion, and can be divided in clear sections, or acts. There is the first act, what is called ‘the setup’ which starts the story. Here, the character(s) and the world they inhabit is introduced. Next, the second act is ‘the confrontation’ where the introduced character(s) are faced with a problem, with some significant change in the world, or character(s). ‘The resolution’ is the last act and the end result of the character(s) handling ‘the confrontation’, the ultimate consequence. 
</p>

<p>
	To be extremely clear, lets have another look at the short fable The Wolf & His Shadow.
</p>

<blockquote>
	“A Wolf left his lair one evening in fine spirits and an excellent appetite.” 
	We are exposed to the wolf in ‘the setup’ where we are introduced to him and his happy state of mind.  

	“As he ran, the setting sun cast his shadow far out on the ground, and it looked as if the wolf were a hundred times bigger than he really was.
	"Why," exclaimed the Wolf proudly, "see how big I am! Fancy me running away from a puny Lion! I'll show him who is fit to be king, he or I.””
</blockquote>

<p>
	Here, in ‘the confrontation’ the wolf is discovering his immense shadow, and is confronted with a significant change of his self image. 
</p>

<p>
	“Just then an immense shadow blotted him out entirely, and the next instant a Lion struck him down with a single blow.“ 
</p>

<p>
	The story is concluded in ‘the resolution’ where the arrogance of the wolf is his undoing as he failed to mind his surroundings due to his immortal illusions. 
</p>

<p>
	The three-act structure usually adheres to a linear structure, or linear narrative. Even most non-linear films adhere to the three-act structure, and are as such not bound to a linear narrative. 

	For instance the non-linear narrative in indie classic <i>Memento</i> directed by Christopher Nolan still has a setup, a confrontation and a resolution, but not in that specific order. The resolution actually occurs twice, one without knowledge of the confrontation, and one with. The film, globally viewed, still introduces us to the characters at the beginning of the film. The action rises with steely detective work after the initial problems and characters are introduced and is concluded in a climax where the protagonist discovers the truth about himself and the people he (doesn’t) know. The film is told backwards; we start at the latest point of story time and end with the earliest point in story time. The film progresses through linear pieces that are played chronologically when seen by itself, they are however sequenced backwards in time. Each piece, or section, starts in the middle of an action, like act two in the three-act structure. The conclusion (the resolution) of each section acts as the introduction (the setup) of the previously shown section. This method ensures that only after viewing the next section in the sequence, that you complete the causality of events. 
</p>

<p>
	Basically, a story told needs to have some sort of introduction, some sort of conflict and a conclusion to prevent the story from being but a senseless array of events. Or as the Scottish critic and writer William Archer explained in his playwriting classic <i>Play-Making</i>:
</p>

<blockquote cite="William Archer, Play-Making, Kessinger Publishing, 2008">
	“It is a grave error, then, to suppose that the act is a mere division of convenience, imposed by the limited power of attention of the human mind, or by the need of the human body for occasional refreshment. A play with a well-marked, well-balanced act-structure is a higher artistic organism than a play with no act-structure, just as a vertebrate animal is higher than a mollusk. In every crisis of real life (unless it be so short as to be a mere incident) there is a rhythm of rise, progress, culmination and solution. We are not always, perhaps not often, conscious of these stages; but that is only because we do not reflect upon our experiences while they are passing, or map them out in memory when they are past. We do, however, constantly apply to real-life crises expressions borrowed more or less directly from the terminology of the drama. We say, somewhat incorrectly, "Things have come to a climax," meaning thereby a culmination; or we say, "The catastrophe is at hand," or, again, "What a fortunate dénouement!" Be this as it may, it is the business of the dramatist to analyze the crises with which he deals, and to present them to us in their rhythm of growth, culmination, and solution. To this end the act-division is--not, perhaps, essential, since the rhythm may be marked even in a one-act play--but certainly of enormous and invaluable convenience. "Si l'acte n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inventer"; but as a matter of fact it has existed wherever, in the Western world, the drama has developed beyond its rudest beginnings.” <sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To be introduced to a problem in the setup, have it escalated in the confrontation and have it concluded in the resolution ensures a clear vision on the causality of depicted events because of our human nature: we perceive time as chronological and view the events around us as a reaction of historical actions. 
</p>

<h1>
	05 - What is the difference between the narrative of a fable and that of a Speculative Design?
</h1>

<p>
	I must clarify myself before heading into this next section, where I will talk about design a bit more generally. I am aware the design label covers a great deal of the creative industry. However, when I talk about design without being specific, I refer to a design approach that does not aim to reach an aesthetically pleasing product or user-friendly product as its sole purpose. The design position I am trying to describe may still of course aim for aesthetic beauty and an easy-to-use product, but it is not the goal, the actual intent, of the design. Rather I am describing a design position that finds its value in causing pause of thought in its audience, which looks for boundaries and breaks conventions. It is a design perspective that is more similar to art, rather than a kind of applied industrial design. When I talk about designers, I am not describing decorators or polishers; rather I am referring to provocateurs and researchers. I am aware of how broad I am describing this perspective on design, but describing it more fully falls outside the scope of this thesis. I do find it important to point out the differences in narrative structure between this general design perspective and that of Speculative Design, which I will do over the next few paragraphs. 
</p>

<p>
	When I view and analyze design or art, I see a conclusion of a conflict, a resolution. An artist or designer has ‘something’ to say. Sometimes it’s an insight, sometimes it’s a critique, sometimes it’s user friendliness, but it always has a message to give; it has a story to tell. For example, when a designer is starting to fabricate a chair, he or she had to have a reason to start the production of that chair. Whatever his or her reasons may be, this is the setup of the design. The actual production can be seen as the confrontation, where fabricating it has its own problems. The finished product is the resolution, where the fabrication problems are overcome and the product is presented.
</p>

<p>
	Take for instance Tjeerd Veenhoven’s <i>Biolaminate</i><sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup>. Veenhoven wondered if he could upgrade biological waste to a more usable material. Using potato peels, oats chaff and fern needles he created laminate tiles able to replace the more common (and environmentally more taxing) wooden laminate. Through experimentation he overcame production problems and was able to fabricate a useable bio laminate. 
</p>

<img src="img/Biolaminate by Tjeerd Veenhoven.jpg" />

<p>
	When viewing a design that is constructed as a finished and usable product, you are only confronted with the end result. The result however is the combination of its conceptual start and its process of production. When you are merely confronted with the finished laminate tile of Veenhoven you can see its biological foundation, but are unaware of the origin of its foundation. A design that tells such a complete story really benefits from an exhibition of some sort, or an accompanying video, or at least, some background information <sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
	When I visit a design exhibition and view its designs, they are often accompanied by a sort of background story and as such: context. Sometimes it is a text, sometimes it is an installation exposing its fabrication methods. In design you are not connected with the whole story as easily as in a book, a design does not tell its story word by word like with a fable. Instead a design tries to communicate the whole story in a single design. The context provided through an exhibition merely helps the viewer on his or her way. 
</p>

<p>
	Similar to the more general design position I described here, Speculative Design is in essence a story. The designer constructs a design that tells that story. Speculative Design’s narrative structure, however, is even more complex than the general design direction in which the final product is generally the conclusion of the work. 
</p>

<p>
	For Speculative Design, the product that is presented to the public is not the conclusion of the work. The product functions more like a confrontation; it is the conflict of the story. 
</p>

<p>
	A Speculative Design’s narrative structure is non-linear; it requires the viewer to make multiple connections to different memories of your historical experiences and expectations of the future simultaneously. 
</p>

<p>
	The object of a Speculative Design produces a conflict: an object is utilized in this futuristic scenario differently then it is presently. The object does have a clear foundation in the present. If this would not be the case, it could have been more easily dismissed as a mere fantasy, and not cause any conflict whatsoever. So, if the conflict is founded in the present, it is introduced there. The technology or system often critiqued in a Speculative Design is always based on a technology or system we have in place now in the present, albeit less extreme or utilized in a vastly different way. The goal of a Speculative Design is to reflect on the technology, understand the effects and complications that it causes in the fictional future. But it also requires you to understand the technologies’ or systems’ position currently. What is its function now? How do I perceive it presently? This view on a specific current technology, based on your past experiences and knowledge of the technology, functions as the setup for the speculative story. 
</p>

<p>
	Take for instance <i>Rusty Knives</i> that I have described earlier. A viewer might have different personal experiences with hormone therapy. Dr. Henry Boardman, post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, concludes in his medical publication 'Hormone therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women': 
</p>

<blockquote cite="Boardman HMP, Hartley L, Eisinga A, Main C, Roque Figuls M, Bonfill Cosp X, Gabriel Sanchez R, Knight B, Hormone therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women (Review), The Cochrane Collaboration, 2015 ">
	“Our review findings provide strong evidence that treatment with hormone therapy in post-menopausal women overall, for either primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events has little if any benefit and causes an increase in the risk of stroke and venous thromboembolic events.” <sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	 When you view hormone therapy more negatively you are contextualizing <i>Rusty Knives</i> differently from someone who views hormone therapy as a purely beneficial medical procedure. Your view on current technology or system introduces the Speculative Design, your past experiences and knowledge of the technology provides context for the design to be placed in. 
</p>

<h2>
	RESOLUTION
</h2>

<p>
	A Speculative Design design poses the question “What if…?”. When you answer dismissive, the design’s function is to activate you to try to deny/disable the designs’ proposed future of becoming real. When answering affirmative, the opposite should occur; it compels you to enable this future.
</p>

<p>
	What does it require of the present, what needs to happen in the present, to enable the technology or system to function in the speculative futuristic scenario as described in the Speculative Design? To enable or disable the design’s prospect (what would become the resolution) happens in the now, the same place where you are introduced to the conflict. The resolution becomes a fortified (if affirmative) or an altered (if dismissive) vision of the present should be. Let’s take an example of a Speculative Design to solidify my vision on the narrative that I just described.
</p>

<img src="img/United Micro Kingdoms by Dunne & Raby01.jpg" />

<p>
	<i>United Micro Kingdoms</i> by design studio Dunne & Raby is one of the Speculative Design’s that I find most successful in achieving its goals and method of achieving them. The design describes four different futuristic governmental and ecological systems. Each society is vastly different from the other, saturated with its own vision of governance and lifestyle. These four ‘super-shires’ are the Digitarians, Bioliberals, Anarcho-evolutionists and Communo-nuclearists. The design works through different media such as objects, literature (both fiction and scientific), photography, social media and video. 
</p>

<img src="img/United Micro Kingdoms by Dunne & Raby - Models of biocars used by the Bioliberal society.jpg" />

<p>
	Each view on lifestyle of the super-shire its society is shown through their use of transport. The shires that these societies inhabit are completely shaped around their lifestyle, and how they choose to transport themselves in their landscape shows how deeply their views influence the whole (infra)structure of the society. The Digitarians’ shire for example, exists of a landscape of endless tarmac on which autonomous vehicles transport isolated members of the public to their destinations. Together with an animation that displays the algorithmic mentality the society possesses, you, as the viewer, become aware of the digital divinity this fictional society praises. Of the four societies, the Digitarians are possibly, as I will point out, the most dystopian yet familiar, and lends itself well for an analysis on non-linear narrative structure as I have described previously.
</p>

<img src="img/United Micro Kingdoms by Dunne & Raby - Render of digicars used by the Digitarian society01.jpg" />

<p>
	At first, you are confronted with the design itself, this might be either the models of the digicars, the animation describing the digicars’ algorithmic movement, or the text accompanying both the video and the object describing what is depicted. You become familiar with the Digitarians’ view on society; digital technology exists to better man and provides mankind with servile utility through tagging, metrics, total surveillance, data logging and 100% transparency. 
</p>

<img src="img/United Micro Kingdoms by Dunne & Raby - Models of digicars used by the Digitarian society02.jpg" />

<p>
	The design, hopefully, makes you wonder if this is what you want for your own future, what if this is the future that will become reality? Is this society that is sketched before you a utopia or dystopia, would you want to live in it? Why?
</p>

<p>
	At the same time, this future does not sound unfamiliar, our society currently is heavily embedded in digital technology, albeit not as extreme as the Digitarians. If technocrats would have their way, the Digitarian future does not seem unlikely. The speculative futuristic scenario Dunne & Raby sketch out with this fictional society reminds us of self-driving cars that are presently being developed by a multitude of companies including but not limited to Google<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup>, Tesla<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup>, Volkswagen<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup>, Citroen<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup>, BMW<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup> and Audi<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup>. The Digitarians, who see numerals and algorithms as sort of ruling entity, appear to find its foundation in the current Silicon Valley companies that profile digital technology as servile machines, able to provide a better life through tracking and connectivity<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup>. 
</p>

<p>
	As I see it, a Speculative Design’s product is a confrontation that tries to activate the viewer or user to reflect on both his or her history / knowledge and desires / vision of the future. It tries to make the viewer aware of the foundation of the future, which is the now. To form a desirable future, that foundation has to be built now. The resolution of the design then becomes an alternate perspective (or a fortified one) in the viewer himself, so he or she can enable or disable the realization of the Speculative Design’s future.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of the Digitarian example: if the viewer would find the fictional society undesirable, he or she should take care not to empower digital technology companies. Be careful of them not gaining totalitarian control over personal data for example. 
</p>

<p>
	This bouncing of viewpoints on a subject, switching from understanding it through a futuristic vision and a present-day interpretation creates the non-linear narrative, and makes Speculative Design more difficult to comprehend. 
</p>

<h1>
	06 – The effect of extremes
</h1>

<p>
	Not only does the non-linear narrative complicate the understanding of Speculative Design, there is also the issue of the extreme scenario as a concept. A speculative design is usually a very extreme form of a technology that we have today. This extreme form is a great tool to expose the foundations of a technology, or at least, its dangers. This applies not only to Speculative Design, but to science fiction as well. A viewer would not feel or understand the dangers of a technology nearly as well if the extremes were tuned down. <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> for example wouldn’t have the same impact on viewers if HAL 9000 was just an assertive calculator with no door control, nor would the <i>Terminator</i> series be as impactful if Skynet was a highly advanced weather forecasting system with no access to a nuclear arsenal. To place a technology into a capable position, the extent of what a technology can achieve becomes clear. 
</p>

<p>
	Interestingly enough, both these examples of HAL 9000 and Skynet closely resemble the Paperclip Maximizer thought experiment: machines that through superior intelligence are out of our control. It is hard to prove but with Nick Bostrom publishing his though experiment in 2003, many years later than the above mentioned movies, makes it seems likely that fictional movies like these have influenced Nick Bostrom. 
</p>

<p>
	The principle, however, remains the same – both in a scientific thought experiment, and in a sensational action-packed movie. Utilizing a technology in an extreme form provides a clearer view of the capabilities of a technology and as such exposes its potential. This extreme perspective is but a possibility of the technology, but through it, you become familiar with its core principles. Beyond Blood<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup>  is a Speculative Design that does this very well and is quite apparent in its moral ethics.
</p>

<img src="img/Beyond Blood by Sures Kumar01.jpg" />

<p>
	The design is a speculative legal system that handles inheritance through algorithms for a deceased that has left no will and the state has to distribute estate. As sort of trial run the film <i>Aviator</i> is used, a romanticized biographical film on American aviator and moviemaker Howard Hughes. He passed in 1976 with no wife, no children and no will. Hughes left US$2.5 billion worth of estate, which was eventually distributed amongst 22 cousins whom he never visited and never liked. In the book <i>Shaping Things</i>, science fiction writer Bruce Sterling predicts that in the near future every object will be tracked and logged by a computer system. He called these objects SPIMES. <i>Beyond Blood</i> builds on this theory to suggest that by tracking people and objects over a number of years, computers will be able to infer the significance of an object to a particular individual.

	Every asset and object is analyzed: who is most emotionally attached, who was possibly the original owner, what was the intention of the deceased and what is the use value? The government could instruct the algorithm to favor one or the other parameter. The system would then automatically distribute the estate.
</p>

<p>
	This project puts an algorithm, one that can most definitely be programmed presently, into a very sensitive decision-making spot. The project showcases the cold-bloodedness an algorithm possesses: a machine cannot feel, it can only measure data. It presumes emotional attachment through the length of possession, but it cannot measure the actual emotional attachment, there is no sensor for this (yet). On the other hand, when all objects are connected and tracked, an algorithm may have a better understanding of different attachments persons might have to an object. <i>Beyond Blood</i> takes a technological system such as ‘The Internet Of Things’ and puts it in a specific speculative scenario of inheritance. In so doing, it exposes the core characteristics of this system/technology: cold-blood calculated omniscience. With the design placing this program in such a sensitive issue as inheritance, the design becomes unnerving and contrasting, making the characteristics so clear. 
</p>

<h2>
	PROBLEMS
</h2>

<p>
	While the extreme position certainly has its uses, it has the danger of being too extreme. When something is far-fetched, too unlikely and not plausible, it is too easily dismissed. Dunne & Raby is a studio that advertises Speculative Design most prominently and also incorporated this design’s principles into the curriculum of the Design Interactions course at the Royal College of Art in London where they both taught from 2005 to 2015. They have published a F.A.Q. on their website in which they explain, very briefly, a sort of ground principle of Speculative Design; what it is, what it is not, what it is inspired by. They answer the question # 10. But isn't it art?” with:
</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.dunneandraby.co.uk/content/bydandr/13/0 Accessed November 2015">
	“It is definitely not art. It might borrow heavily from art in terms of methods and approaches but that's it. We expect art to be shocking and extreme. Critical Design needs to be closer to the everyday, that's where its power to disturb comes from. Too weird and it will be dismissed as art, too normal and it will be effortlessly assimilated. If it is regarded as art it is easier to deal with, but if it remains as design it is more disturbing, it suggests that the everyday as we know it could be different, that things could change.” <sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I agree. Simply labeling it design, however, does not distinguish it from art, or from being extreme. I do not blame them, Dunne & Raby’s work sits very rigorously in the design spectrum and I would not imply they create art or too extreme scenarios. However, it is most definitely extreme, as the technologic object that is featured in Speculative Design is sitting on the edges of what is plausible. For it to be extreme is the foundation of Speculative Design as only then are we made aware of its inherent potential and does the design reach an impact. It does not want to be extreme for extreme’s sake however. It does want to disturb, and as such it should be a comprehendible extreme. I believe a good speculative design does not sit somewhere between the normal and the extreme, but is both at the same time. The design has a ‘normal’ foundation, placed in an extreme scenario. 
</p>

<p>
	Earlier on I described the object that is featured in a Speculate Design as an archeological artifact of its fictional world. I will propose in the following paragraphs that the object or artifact that is currently positioned as the main feature of the design becomes a MacGuffin. In so doing, the attention shifts more towards the scenario that is the essence of the work. Speculative Design will shift to a more anthropological position. 
</p>

<h2>
	MACGUFFIN 
</h2>

<p>
	The MacGuffin (or McGuffin or Maguffin) is a plot-device used in film and literature, which the legendary Alfred Hitchcock frequently used in his films. The origin of the device is somewhat unclear. Hitchcock’s screenwriter and friend Angus MacPhail popularized the term, but credits the French director Rudyard Kipling as the spiritual father of the MacGuffin<sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup>.  Angus MacPhail once explained the MacGuffin using an old Scottish tale that goes as follows:
</p>

<blockquote cite="http://narrativefirst.com/articles/the-macguffin-is-a-joke Accessed 22 November 2015">
	“One man says “What’s that package up there in the baggage rack?”, and the other answers “Oh that’s a McGuffin”. The first one asks “What’s a McGuffin?”. “Well”, the other man says, “It’s an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands”. The first man says “But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands”, and the other one answers “Well, then that’s no McGuffin!”. So you see, a McGuffin is nothing at all.” <sup><a href="#33">33</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<img src="img/Indiana Jones and the Arc of the Covenant" />

<p>
	A MacGuffin is nothing and everything simultaneously. In film or literature, a MacGuffin is usually an object (or person) that the protagonist and the antagonist desperately want or need. It is merely an incentive for the story’s characters. What the actual thing is, or the importance, is only implied and rarely explained other than the need for it. It is a tool for the story to revolve around, to move the story forward and to give it cause for a conflict to exist. Alfred Hitchcock often utilized the MacGuffin and appears in film such as <i>North by Northwest</i> where the MacGuffin is the government secrets, in <i>Number Seventeen</i> it is the necklace and in <i>The 39 Steps</i> they are the top-secret plans for a new aircraft engine. Not only Hitchcock used the MacGuffin, George Lucas (<i>Star-wars</i>, <i>Indiana Jones</i>) is a frequent user as well. The servile little robot R2-D2 is the MacGuffin of <i>Star Wars</i>, most significantly in parts IV, V and VI. <i>Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Last Ark</i> where the Arc of the Covenant is the MacGuffin. All we are told of its significance: “It belongs in a museum!”. Without these objects the films could not have existed, there would have been no start to the adventure, there would have been no beginning of the conflict between characters and the world they inhabit. At the same time the actual object does not matter, the Arc of the Covenant could have been any powerful holy relic or something the Nazi’s want to obtain power and something Jones wants to preserve for education. The movie <i>Indiana Jones and the Arc of the Covenant</i> is not really about the Arc, it is about the conflict between the Nazi’s and Jones (or America), between obtaining power to enforce your will onto your environment and preserving power to educate humankind on dangers of having power. The object – the MacGuffin – that instigated the conflict is of no importance; the conflict of its surroundings is what matters. 
</p>

<p>
	What I propose is to diminish the importance of the object that is the centerpiece of most Speculative Design. Rather I feel the object should be viewed and handled as interchangeable, let the object be an instigator, a representation of conflict instead of it being the conflict. The world it is representing is then positioned more prominently.
</p>

<p>
	<i>United Micro Kingdoms</i> by Dunne & Raby is a design that does this really well. The design is more of an exposition where the small models of transportations are the common denominator that binds the exhibition together. In <i>United Micro Kingdoms</i> I see the transportation models as MacGuffins: they represent the world, and instigate the conflict between our current view on structure of society and what we would want this structure to be in the future. The design is actually a collection of views on different structures – different ideologies. Through an array of information each different perspectives of the future can be seen isolated. Through accumulation of the cons and pros of each ideology the audience can assemble internally their own vision of their preferred future, how society in their view should be structured. The design equips the audience with grip on how to form a view, it does not provide the view; it supplies elements for a personal prospect of the future. This method of assembling an opinion, or perspective, is quit similar to what the Paris based professor on French literature Pierre Bayard describes in his book <i>How to Talk About Book’s You Haven’t Read</i>. Bayard argues how the relationship between numerous books (or ideas) is more important than the actual book (or idea) itself. He explains that in a conversation on a book, where it remains ambiguous, as the book is unread, it provides possibilities of creating ones own opinion of the idea(s) embedded in the book without being constrained with the actual content of the book. Or, as he concludes: 
</p>

<blockquote cite="Pierre Bayard, How to Talk About Books you Haven’t Read, Bloomsbury, 2007">
	“But it is equally necessary to make this effort to change so that we can listen to ourselves, without missing the private resonances that connect us to every work and whose roots go deep in our history. The encounter with unread books will be more enriching—and sharable with others—if the person undergoing it draws his inspiration from deep within himself. 

	This different mode of listening to texts and to oneself again recalls what may reasonably be expected from psycho­ analysis, the primary function of which is to free the patient from his inner constraints and, by the end of a journey over which he remains the sole master, to open him up to all his creative possibilities.“ <sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A Speculative Design is a conversation between the designer(s) – speaking through the scenario of the design – and the audience, where the actual objects of the design do not matter. The conflict between the designed scenario and the preferred scenario of the viewer is what is important. The object of the design is merely the provider and instigator of the conversation. 
</p>

<h1>
	07 - Conclusion
</h1>

<p>
	I see great potential in Speculative Design; however, I propose a restructure of its narrative where the focus of the Speculative Design’s object rests on instigation of conflict between the proposed scenario in the design and that of the preferred scenario of a member of the audience that is confronted with the design.
</p>

<p>
	The non-linear narrative – bouncing between a present-day view of a technology and that of the speculative future in the design – complicates the comprehension of a fictional scenario but must remain an integral part of Speculative Design. The design must reference both the present and the speculative future for it to create a conflict. Merely describing a future does not create friction as it can be easily dismissed as fantasy. 
</p>

<p>
	I propose the object functions as an archeological artifact from the future, where it, in an anthropological sense, describes the scenario – the embodiment – of the object/artifact. Doing this the artifact can be seen as a MacGuffin. It does not matter what the object is, in a sense, as long as it portrays its scenario sufficiently. It could be any object from its fictional world, as long as it describes it successfully and proves the plausibility of the scenario through physicality of the artifact.
</p>

<p>
	To prevent the artifacts from becoming abstract when exposed isolated from their scenario I envision a method of Speculative Design where the artifact isn’t singular, but instead an array of artifacts is presented. This array of objects can be a futuristic chronology of revisions, which end up to the most extreme version of itself. That extreme version will be a representation of the scenario that should conflict with a scenario of how a technology is employed currently. The chronological array should evolve onwards, starting with the technology in its current form and how it is currently utilized and ending at its most extreme application. This method will introduce a more linear section in the design; through this it is clear that the future has a clear origin in the present. Through the exposition of revisions – the evolution of them – it becomes clear that an object is the product of its past and that someone might alter that end product by altering the causal chain. The viewer becomes conscious of the foundation of an extreme technology is being shaped presently and can thus be acted upon now.
</p>

<p>
	Another method I feel should be beneficial for the narrative structure of Speculative Design is to introduce a level of interactivity between the product and the viewer. I envision this to have a similar effect like that of the previous example. Through interactivity – being able to alter the artifact – you can mold the scenario that the artifact represents. If the design in some way displays the scenario – the embodiment of the artifact – in a video for example, which undergoes change whenever the artifact is altered; the viewer (or user in this case) is made aware that a future is but a reaction of its historical actions. Through interaction the user is conscious of the malleability of the future.
</p>


<p>
	In any case, Speculative Design should strive for a method that leaves room for a viewer to incorporate their own perspective of a technology that is current while enabling them to envision a preferred implementation of a technology that is futuristic. By placing the object or artifact more to the background and positioning the scenario more prominently I believe Speculative Design will better reach its goals; to enable critical thought in the viewer on current technology and how it should evolve. While I tried to provide tools on how to view a Speculative Design in its current form I am curious to see how Speculative Design itself will evolve into a form that enables a better relation between the viewer and the speculative scenario, which I experience as imbalanced in most current Speculative Designs.
