<h1>
	00 – INTRODUCTION
</h1>

<p>
	Speculative Design is a contemporary design method that poses questions about current and emerging technologies using the design medium in a futuristic sense. By employing a technology in a futuristic sense, contextualizing it in fiction, the design provides grip on the technology in its current state. By posing “what ifs?”, a discussion opens up on the desirability of such futures, and what it requires from the present to prevent or facilitate them.
</p>

<p>
	<cite src="http://www.dynamicgenetics.co.uk">Dynamic Genetics vs. Mann</cite> by Superflux<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> serves as a good example of this design method. Dynamic Genetics vs. Mann is a collection of evidence in a fictional and speculated court case. The premise is set in a not to distant future, where private genetic therapy can, due to technological advancements in bioengineering, severely reduces health risks. Privatization in the health sector (which is occurring, non-fictionally, currently in Britain) increased the prices for genetic therapy drastically. When the protagonist, Arnold Mann, is diagnosed with a health risk, he is caught between the increased premium of his health insurance and the expensive gene therapy by private cooperation’s. 
	Through a range of objects and media such as photographs, artifacts, documents and video footage the audience is asked to explore the politics of power and control. 
</p>

<p>
	By exposing the audience to this fictional world that is derived of current politics the audience is asked: what is desirable? Advancements in bioengineering might provide us with better health but in exchange for increased control of the manufacturers. What does it require of the present to facilitate or prevent this future? Is halting privatization of the health sector enough? Does halting it prevent the advancement of gene therapy?

<p>
	The goal of a speculative design is to generate critical questions in the audience.
</p>

<p>
	The speculative method of envisioning the future has a pitfall though. When creating a fictional world, immersing a viewer becomes that much more important. To make a Speculative Design future justifiable a viewer needs to believe it. The fantasy does not become relevant until it has a clear origin in the present, making the fantastical scenario possible and conceivable. When it is not, or structured poorly, the design becomes extreme, far fetched. While the technology envisioned in the Speculative Design might be possible, the lack of causality and clear structure makes it undemanding for the viewer to detach him- or herself from the design and to disassociate him- or herself from the problem.
</p>

<p>
	When utilizing a futuristic perspective as in Speculative Design, what narrative structure does it require for a designer to provide the viewer with an understanding of a plausible future conflict while ensuring that the extremity of the futuristic perspective does not enable detachment between the viewer and the design? 
</p>

<h2>
	PRESENT FUTURES 
</h2>

<p>
	Though quite a few Speculative Designs present us with futures that are believable, I often find the narrative structure used within these designs as incomplete and skewed. I will discuss these narrative structures in depth in this thesis, juxtaposed against narrative structures of other storytelling mechanisms such as fables and myths. Fables and myths have a very similar function to Speculative Design: to educate its audience of unfavorable consequences of actions. 
</p>

<p>
	The narrative structure of fables and myths however is vastly more mature and easier to understand then that of Speculative Design. Fables and myths utilize a linear structure to explain causality. This causality is lacking, or at the very least, harder to find in Speculative Design. Positioning the narrative structure of Speculative Design next to that of fables and myths make clear this deficiency of causality in Speculative Design create an absence of clarity. 
</p>

<p>
	Through speculation you are forced to think about the present as the speculative problem is derived of present events. Dr. Joseph Voros, a PhD in theoretical physics and professional futurist wrote a brief introduction to futuristic possibilities in the article <i>A Primer on Futuristic Studies, Foresight and the Use of Scenarios</i>.
</p>

<blockquote cite="Dr. Joseph Voros, ‘A Primer on Futuristic Studies, Foresight and the Use of Scenarios’, Prospect, 2001">
	"The actual future (singular) which eventuates, and in which we will ultimately live and experience as "the present" at that time, will be governed by our actions (or inaction) in this present, along with the choices we have made among many alternative potential futures (plural). Our choices and the passage of time reduce the infinite field of potentialities to a single experienced actuality, which then passes into history and cannot be changed. In other words, and this is the key point, we can only have an influence on the potentialities of the "yet to be" and can do nothing about the "what has already been". Therefore, let us try to create a better present moment (and thus past history), by choosing more wisely and responsibility among out potential alternative futures.” <sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Speculative Design searches for plausible futures, something that could happen and stems from our current scientific, cultural and/or political knowledge. The plausible is embedded into the possible, whereas the plausible is more believable. As Dr. Joseph Voser explains:
</p>

<blockquote src="Dr. Joseph Voros, ‘A Primer on Futuristic Studies, Foresight and the Use of Scenarios’, Prospect, 2001.">
	“<b>Possible futures.</b> This class of futures includes all the kinds of futures we can possibly imagine - those which "might happen" - no matter how far-fetched, unlikely or "way out". They might, as a result, involve knowledge which we do not yet possess (the "warp drive" of Star Trek is a good example), or might also involve transgressions of currently-accepted physical laws or principles. I tend to characterise these futures as being reliant on the existence of some future knowledge (i.e. knowledge we do not yet possess) in order to come about. 
	[…]
	<b>Plausible futures.</b> This class encompasses those futures which "could happen" (i.e. they are not excluded) according to our current knowledge (as opposed to future knowledge) of how things work. They stem from our current understanding of physical laws, processes, causation, systems of human interaction, etc. This is clearly a smaller subset of futures than the possible.” <sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
	By imagining wild non-plausible scenarios it has the possibility of degrading into fantasy. Thus, to envision something plausible you have to incorporate the present, or at the very least, current knowledge. 
</p>

<p>
	By extrapolating the present into an undesirable future you become aware of present issues that need to be addressed to prevent this unwanted future. Speculative Design uses this cautionary method in objects, installations, books and films. It provides a glimpse of the future through the design. The object functions as a future artifact, almost as proof of its plausibility. When the design is presented in a physical form this becomes even clearer, especially when it has a working and existent form in the present. <i>After Life Euthanasia Device</i> <sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> by Dunne & Raby is a work that employs such physicality. <i>After Life Euthanasia Device</i> uses a battery, <i>Afterlife</i>, fabricated by designers James Auger and Jimmy Loizeau. This battery is charged through a deceased person biomaterial to create a chemical reaction that provides power for the battery. Dunne & Raby made a device that a widowed person could use to end their own life, using the afterlife power of their deceased loved ones. The device is a carbon dioxide dispenser that is power by the Afterlife battery that will assist their left behind loved one to join him or her in the afterlife (afterlife being a battery or otherwise).
</p>

<p>
	All the components – the euthanasia device, the battery, the carbon dioxide – function. It is however not fabricated for commercial appliance, but to question our believes of afterlife. The physical fabrication is in ways a sort of proof of plausibility.
</p>

<p>
	When confronted with the designed object the viewer is presented with a problem. Rarely does Speculative Design pose a desirable future. It mostly serves as a warning mechanism. Take for instance <i>Dynamic Genetics vs. Mann</i>: be wary of the control genetic therapy clinics can exert on the public when given free reign. <i>After Life Euthanasia Device</i> also questions the desirability of technological achievements. Should a person be able to persist after death? What influence can the entity exert on loved ones left behind? Is it desirable? The design confronts the viewer with a conflict, an issue or an unwelcome effect of current affairs. 
</p>

<p>
	The product of the designer is shown in isolation, as if brought from some foreign place, ripped from its environment. The future that the design inhabits is not there yet, but the product is here now, functioning in its entire splendor and warning us of its functions, safely in our comfortable present. 
</p>

<h2>
	FABLE
</h2>

<p>
	While Speculative Design is a fairly new method of cautionary communication, it is certainly not the first. The fable or myth has filled a similar role in the past. 
	While the fable does not use a futuristic perspective, it does warn its reader or listener in a similar fashion: presenting harmful effects of actions. 
</p>

<p>
	The fable for example tells a story of morality: be fair, be just, be ethical, or face the consequences. The fable often speaks of wrongful actions of characters that are sequentially punished for these actions or meet some kind of unfortunate fate. As a result, the reader or listener is warned not to behave in a similar fashion, as he or she might undergo the same fate. For example in Red Riding Hood, you are warned not to stray from the path or harm will befall you from forest animals. 
</p>

<h2>
	THREE-ACT STRUCTURE 
</h2>

<p>
	Fables, myths and folklores like these are nearly all structured in the same way. Screenwriter Christopher Vogler explains this structure in his book <cite src="Christopher Vogler, The Writer’s Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers, Michael Wiese Productions, 1992">The Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers</cite><sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> which mentions the three-act structure. It is a structure still found in many films and books and is prevalent in how we think about traditional storytelling. The structure describes the story in three acts: the setup, the confrontation and the resolution. 
</p>

<p>
	The setup provides an understanding of the world the story is situated in and provides background of characters. The confrontation act starts when the protagonist of the story is faced with the issue the story will resolve around. The resolution is how the conflict or confrontation will be resolved: how, or if, it will be overcome. 
</p>

<p>
	Nearly all fables and myths fit perfectly inside this structure, and most present-day stories still do. This structure is greatly suited for fiction and non-fiction alike, as the linearity of this narrative provides great insight into causality. One event causes the next, which in return causes the next event, etc. This structure provides clarity as the chronological order of events teaches us that actions have clear consequences. When having heard the story of Red Riding Hood, you know the cause of the initial conflict was straying of the woodland path, and so the listener is taught not to do so if he or she wants to keep safe. 
</p>

<h2>
	LINEARITY OF THE FUTURE 
</h2>

<p>
	I will use the three-act structure to analyze the narrative structure of Speculative Design in order to pinpoint the main problem, in my opinion, of cautionary future fictions. In most cases, a Speculative Design poses just the confrontation act. The setup act is actually our present, our everyday surroundings. The goal of a Speculative Design is for the viewer to reach an introvert resolution. This resolution is, however, an alternative setup, a shift in our present. Because the conflict that the design presents is a futuristic one, we can be ahead of it. By not creating the cause of the conflict, we resolve it.
