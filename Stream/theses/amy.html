	<h1 class="chapterTitle">INTRODUCTION</h1>
	<p class="introQuote"> God, on the progress of mankind:
	“Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.” <br><i> - Genesis 11: 1-7 </i></p>

	<p> Once in a while, in the middle of a reverie, reality hits me realising how lucky a person should be to experience life. I often get lost in questions regarding existentialism: what does it mean to be alive? Some might say life is about experience, creating success, happiness or love. Others may see life as a functional and natural principal, where people need to unite and develop society and culture to extend humanity. Tools and technology were created to make life easier. With the increase of these developments regarding technology we create more leisure. We then have time to think about our lives, trying to make the most of it. Personal bucket lists are compiled in the hope that these wishes will fulfil certain expectations during ones time on earth. Some may even believe that bucket lists represent one’s identity. We seem obsessed with life and prefer to focus on existence rather than what happens after death. This may seem logical, because who would want to spend time on death when consciousness after life is not guaranteed? Why put energy in such an unreliable subject? With today’s technology developing over time, would it be possible to guarantee an artificial afterlife and if so, what is the motivation for one?
	<br>
	As a non-believer, I too desire the promise of some form of life after death like believers do. I too want to give meaning to my own life rather than my presence fading over time. Through art, most religions have offered glimpses of an afterlife, motivating many to follow instructions during their time on earth. Life to believers can be interpreted as a preparation rather than an experience. 
	<br>
	I strongly believe that art has played an important part in religion. Paintings depicting scenes from the bible were often convincing enough for people to believe in an afterlife, but never has an e.g. Christian afterlife been proven scientifically. To me it is shocking that a vast majority of today’s society believes in a theological afterlife, dedicating their lives to something that is not guaranteed. I regard technology and interaction design as a new faith, believing these two may foresee a scientifically guaranteed artificial afterlife. Interaction with technology has become a great part of our lives. Why then, can this not continue in the afterlife? For example the smartphone: it is an extension of our body and identity. Losing a smartphone can cause panic, not because it’s just a piece of electricity; it contains personal notes, contacts, messages, photos, videos, music and more. The smartphone is an extension that can continue its activity after its owner’s death. I see the phone as a metaphor for the human soul, which continues to live on after death.
	<br>
	Some may find it unusual to interpret technology like the smartphone as a spiritual being. Theoretically speaking - today’s smartphone is recognised as an inanimate object and anything but spiritual. Personally I think technological products are very much animate and potentially artificially spiritual. We do have a humanlike relationship with technology, it’s just not perceived like this due to taboos and techno-phobias regarding technology, for example: ideas regarding uploading the human brain into robotics, which some may find morbid. I strongly believe these boundaries may be broken through interaction design. Art could foresee an answer for these death related techno-phobias, as it is known for breaking taboos and domesticating certain ideas. I believe interaction designers can offer interesting forms of artificial afterlife and normalise subjects like death and pseudoscience. 
	<br>
	Interesting is how technology, based on scientific principles, can be interpreted as spiritual. It is a contradiction, for technology is scientifically proven where as spiritualism and theology are based on faith. Using technological media to prove the existence of divinity or spirituality is pseudoscience. An example of such is the Electro Magnetic Field (EMF) meter, a popular tool amongst paranormal investigators aiming to find proof of paranormal activity. These ghost hunters claim that the tool, originally used to detect electrical charged objects such as microwaves and fridges, also pick up ghostly presences. They interpret electro magnetic fields as spirits, which to me are both insane as inspiring. I’m not convinced by the paranormal investigator’s theory. In fact, I’m not even interested whether it’s true or false. As an interaction designer however, I do find it interesting how paranormal investigators see potential in technology as a spiritual related media. I agree; many may not approve spiritual technological media, but supernatural media certainly can be designed artificially.
	<br>
	The following example demonstrates how some products are remediated into the spiritual with the help of technology. This work is inspiring as it convinces me as a visitor as well as an artificial afterlife believer. The project doesn’t claim to be seen as proof (that the created afterlife is reality); rather it examines the potential of a hypothetical afterlife.
	<br>
	The installation <i>Collector</i> by Chinese artist HsienYu Cheng may appear as an eighties children’s room: the space invaders computer game displayed on an old television rests on a shelf with a joystick in front of it. Next to the console game is a TL tube and a large digit counter. At the time the artwork was located in a space containing fruit flies. Attracted by the TL light, the flies would die and give an electrical current when getting in contact with the lamp. This current then triggered the digit counter, enabling visitors to play space invaders. Each suicide would present one game life. Although I’m not in favour of this cruelty, this work represents a nice metaphor for the technological afterlife. The physical contact with technology enables a life form to be virtually converted. The same interaction can be found in death related photography such as post mortem pictures, where the deceased are being captured through a camera. By pressing the shutter button, the physical life is seized and converted into an artefact. 
	<br>
	In his book <i>Necromedia</i> Marcel O’Gorman examines the relation of technological medias and death. In this he suggests that humans have denied their demise ever since we’ve used technology. This may explain why Japanese humanoid developer Hiroshi Ishiguro created a robot counterpart: to extend his own life artificially through technology. The same applies to <i>Collector</i> and post mortem photography.
	<br>
	Gothic horror novels such as <i>Dracula</i> (1897) and <i>Frankenstein</i> (1818) play a great part for the inspiration of artificial afterlife. The Victorian society was new to technological and scientific developments, resulting in misinterpretations of medias such as the telephone or electricity. Electricity and signals were comprehended as magic or paranormal; how else would a person speak to someone from the other side of the world? This remediation (from the scientific based to spiritual) will be researched to see how society responds, but also how this affects society.
	<br>
	As interaction designer and non-believer I want to research how an artificial afterlife can be realised with the help of technology and art. This question will be answered with the help of the following sub questions: how does the afterlife commonly manifest itself in various belief systems? What are the motives of current artificial afterlife? Does the idea of an artificial afterlife inherently hold any drawbacks? What attributes could be considered vital to an artificial afterlife? How would one moderate and control an artificial afterlife? 
	It is vital to explore these questions with the help of artistic projects hopefully answering why an artificial afterlife should be built artistically/by artists.
	<br>
	When explaining acquaintances about artificial afterlife or spiritual inspired art, they associate this with sci-fi and consider the notion a gimmick, irresponsible and selfish. Rather than writing a post bible, I wish to convince people about the domestication of artificial afterlife. I like to take on this challenge, because I believe that interaction designers have the ability to bring remediation of devices to a whole different level.

	<br><i> - Tegenlicht: De robot als mens (VPRO)
	</i></p>

	<p> Dracula, safety coffins (a normal coffin that is fitted with special attachments for use in the event that a person be buried alive in it ), black clothing, post -mortem photography, paranormal communication devices such as the planchette (a tool to communicate with the supernatural ) and other ideas referring to death were popular concepts in the Victorian era. It is said that the Victorian’s obsession with death is related to Darwin’s discovery on the existence of life and his questioning of the authenticity of the Bible, concerning the genesis of man.  When society began to doubt faith, science became more popular as it provided a new appreciation of life.  Death and science often went hand in hand, science possibly providing more reliable answers and solutions in relation to the afterlife.  Take for example the American-Hungarian illusionist Harry Houdini, who debunked spiritualism through acts on stage, showing the audiences the tricks charlatans used on their clients. 
	<br>
	Culture in the 19th century was soon engaged with the convergence of science and death, resulting in new and inventive ideas. One classic literary example is the gothic novel <i>Frankenstein</i> (English author Mary Shelley) that introduced the world to the now famous monster, inspired by Galvanism: a method by which lifeless muscles can be moved through electricity. It was the innovative experiments with corpses supposedly conducted by the German alchemist Johann Konrad Dippel that inspired Shelley to create the character resurrected by electricity.  Her idea does not only call into question the relationship between science and life, but also tackles the further subject of the afterlife.

	<br>
	Technology, science and biology have advanced incredibly since the Victorian era, helping us to understand certain phenomena that were inexplicable in the past, for example near death experiences. A recent study by Mongolian Jimo Borjigin reports the brain activity of rats after clinical death. According to her study the high-pitched brain activity might explain why near-death survivors claim to have seen light at the end of the tunnel or a vision of heaven whilst dying.  Although there are many phenomena that have yet to be answered by science, many spiritual reports have been debunked by technology. A sceptic or non-believer like myself might find it very difficult to comprehend why so many still believe in the spiritual whilst living in such a high tech world.
	<br>
	According to the website Adherent.com, 16% of the world population is nonreligious. Christianity is the largest religious group and eastern religions like Buddhism the smallest.  Although 84% of the population claims to be religious, it is believed that faith in religion will diminish eventually.  With technology and science advancing even further over time, it is possible that these two disciplines could be responsible for religion’s downfall. For that reason it is understandable that science and technology may be sensitive subjects for the fundamental religious.
	<br>
	If the population’s percentage of believers were to fall, it would not necessarily mean that all theological and spiritual ideas regarding afterlife should or will be forgotten. In fact, a potential renaissance of afterlife could be predicted. Designers might find holy scripture for example truly useful when designing an artificial afterlife. It is a historical essay on existentialism containing rules, guidance and above all an (fantastical) indication of life after death. Today the world counts approximately 4,200 religions, of which many have unique traits. Whether religion remains beloved by loyal followers or not, their ideas on afterlife could influence designers, creating new forms of artificial afterlife. Perhaps artificial afterlife is a simulated heaven, as recognised in the bible or maybe it borrows ideas from the bible, yet totally different in its appearance. 
	<br>
	In <i>Gramophone, Film, Typewriter</i> (1999) German author Friedrich Kittler seems to be a true escapist; romanticizing over artificial afterlife originating straight out of the unconscious creative mind rather than books. According to him writers will no longer be needed when memories, dreams the dead and ghosts will be technological reproducible. Who needs the creative trained minds such as writers and designers when the human mind does the creative work during sleeping, producing interesting forms of afterlife unconsciously?  I agree partially; with so many different interpretations on the afterlife found in literature it would be interesting to see what other forms the human mind can bring to visualise such phenomena. I do think that the unconscious creative mind brings chaos and randomness, which needs structure for this phenomenon to be realised. This is where I believe artists come into play: to structure and control the chaotic mind. How would an interactive designer for example structure a potential artificial afterlife originated from random dreams or memories? Perhaps Holy Scripture can be used as a guideline or inspiration source for designers. What conceivable forms of afterlife, however, could be considered right or wrong? Should the Bible, Qur’an or perhaps the Torah influence interaction designers? Western and Eastern doctrines alone have incredibly different views on afterlife. In this chapter I will explore Western and Eastern relations with the afterlife. This way I hope to find out how the world, still influenced by doctrines, would relate to artificial afterlife. By exploring the two societies relation towards artificial afterlife, we also get a better understanding of what afterlife could be. 
	<br>
	Throughout centuries, Western and Asian regions have each developed culturally and socially. Certain Eastern traditions are interpreted as strange, awkward and even disturbing by Western society and vice versa. Particularly on the subject of death, these two societies seem to have contrary notions. Both societies have their own interpretation on existence and deal with death and life differently. This influences culture and reflects in products. A media or product for example is perceived entirely different in Japan in comparison to America. Most interesting is the difference in interaction between the product and human. Having said that, there is one non-physical entity both world parts believes in: the soul. The definition of the soul however, is interpreted differently, resulting in different forms of afterlife.  It is important to discuss these diverse definitions of the soul in order to see how this affects our behaviour towards products.
	<br>
	Since the Ancient Greeks, Western society’s definition of the soul has had various meanings, answering the problem that concerned many in those days: how could humans survive death? Biological speculations – from spines containing indigestible bones preserving bodily identity between life, death and afterlife, to indigestible human flesh – were considered irrelevant after the immaterial soul was conceived. The soul was now a sort of dynamic entity, ‘moving on to a new life without loss of identity’. 
	<br>
	Most Western doctrines, including Ancient Greek theology and Christianity, appeared to believe in souls as ghost-like entities: the soul leaving its original and physical body and passing onto one, two or three spiritual realms. One realm for the blessed (Paradise, Heaven or The Promised Land) and one for the condemned (Hell/the underworld).  Christianity has one other realm: Limbo (here it is yet undetermined where the soul should go: heaven or hell). Depending on the life someone led, one of these kingdoms could be entered. 
	<br>
	Although the Bible describes Heaven and Hell well, it is interesting that well-known artists from the past have been inspired by Dante Alighieri’s <i>The Divine Comedy</i>: a poem that described with a hallucinating quality the three worlds of the afterlife: Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. Dante’s motive was “to show [Christians] the moral choices they face”.  Like Dante Alighieri, artist such as Sandro Botticelli, Robert Rauschenberg, Auguste Rodin, Gustave Doré and Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux also focussed on and were inspired by the terrifying side of Christianity. 
	<br>
	Knowing that illustrations on the aforementioned topic were extremely influential to illiterates, it is understandable that Christians were more worried and insecure about their afterlives than comforted. These artists played a powerful and convincing god-like role to Christians, creating a vision of afterlife, based upon personal interpretations.
	<br>
	It could be said that the Japanese robot sociologist Naho Kitano agrees with my supposition that fear seems to be dominating in the West regarding afterlife related art. In the documentary <i>De robot als mens</i>, Kitano also explains this is to do with the influence of Christian doctrines on artists.  As a child of non-believers, I was unsettled and scared of dying after seeing the artworks in Christian churches. The morbid paintings and kitsch sculptures still make a huge and negative impact on me. Never have I perceived the attraction of dying and going to Heaven peacefully in a church. And I wouldn’t be convinced if I was a Christian either. Perhaps having set step into a minimalistic Japanese Shinto or Asian Buddhist temple might have made me more rational towards afterlife. In other words: in Western religious art, specifically within Catholicism, fear seems to be dominating factor in comparison to other doctrines. 
	<br>
	According to Kitano, Japanese culture does not believe in a catholic spirit, rather it believes that “any substantial item has some sort of soul”.  With this, she also refers to non-biological things like robots. She continues by saying that an object can gain a soul, simply when interaction is involved. The Japanese respect this idea, unlike the West, because they “understand society more as a harmonization”.

	<br>
	In the article 'Endless Fun' the American scientist and author Michael Graziano speculates on artificial afterlife and the influence it could have on society. Interesting is his example of artificial afterlife: retaining a humans consciousness and placing that into a different housing. A computer or robot for example would be the deceased’s new skin. Again, it is notable how a Western author views artificial afterlife, using mostly opponents in his text, criticizing the idea. His main worry is how “it [artificial afterlife] will utterly transform humanity, probably in ways that are more disturbing than helpful.”  He goes on to contemplate that people will selfishly end their lives prematurely due to the promise of the eternal afterlife. Graziano understands the afterlife as a limitless phenomenon and as a “natural outgrowth of the entertainment industry.”  It is interesting how different the Japanese society perceives artificial afterlife. They have a more positive approach towards the subject and accept sci-fi related afterlife like robots. 
	<br>
	According to Canadian author Marcel O’Gorman uploading the human brain into a device is in Western society considered taboo, as products cannot be inhabited by biological life. They simply are “inanimate objects”, unable to have any “intentions, no consciousness, and certainly no ill will towards” someone. 
	<br>
	With today’s technological society, in which we try to improve artificial intelligence, I find it hard to believe that products are inanimate objects. As interaction designer I am aware of the impact a product could have. They certainly have intentions and sometimes even fatal ones.  
	In his book <i>Necromedia</i> (2004) O’Gormon gives an example of such fatal consequences: “During the huge growth in internet usage […], the [Asian] countries experienced an epidemic of tech-related social problems, including internet and computer game addiction, mass suicide via webcam, and even computer-enabled “karoshi” (death by overwork)”.  These horrible incidents did not only take place in the East, but also in the West. Take for example the 24-year-old Dutch Call of Duty gamer: Tristan van der Vlis, who shot six people in Alphen a/d Rijn. Interesting is Western societies’ reaction, blaming video game productions for manipulating their children’s mind through violent video games, unlike the East who blame today’s game addicted society for these incidents.<<br>  
	The West clearly has issues regarding artificial or designed afterlife. Artificial afterlife is considered either taboo or a dream for escapists and nerds. A technological feasible afterlife seems to have gotten a bad reputation due to the film industry in America. Take for example <i>Ringu</i> (1998), a Japanese horror film, about a mysterious video, killing whoever views it, unless that viewer can solve its mystery.  Tasteless American replicas of these j-horror films that make their way into Hollywood have one goal: entertainment. I’m not a supporter of the later adapted blockbuster the <i>Ring</i> (U.S. 2002), but these films do highlight our interesting technophobia history. In <i>Telephone: The First Hundred Years</i>, author John Brooks explains how fear for new developments in technology delayed certain inventions such as the telephone: “People were made very uneasy by the notion. Hearing voices when there was no one there was looked upon as a manifestation of either mystical communion or insanity.”  

	<div class="image">
		<img src="">
		<div>
			<h2>Figure 3: From the 2002 film The Ring</h2>
		</div>
	</div>

	<br>
	A different type of this Western uneasiness towards technology was experienced when the interviewee of the <i>Tegenlicht</i> documentary <i>De robot als mens</i> was asked to touch a robot that seemed to be inhabited by a soul: “It almost feels intimate, touching her”.  Although he is unable to explain why this is strange, it could be said that (again) this is due to the way we have different relationships with products/designs. Animistic tendencies are often associated with people having sexual relationships with their cars, balloons or even architecture. These people are often portrayed as freaks on television channels such as TLC. 
	<br>
	All together, I too believe it would take a while before artificial afterlife is established (seriously) in society. A shame, for only a small part of the world will contribute in potential new and interesting developments. Fortunately I see light at the end of the tunnel for Western enthusiasts like myself, because I believe the art industry can break taboos. On many occasions, interaction designers are given the opportunity to reinterpret domesticated medias such as the television. The interaction designer’s interpretation of the television for example, could lose its entertaining function and gain a new one. Perhaps one that relates more to afterlife, domesticating the subject of death.   
	<br>
	Now that we know that afterlife has many interpretations around the world, influencing society and culture, we also have a better understanding of the current market for potential artificial afterlife. It seems as if the West regards artificial afterlife as entertainment whereas Japan seems to perceive it as a daily need. 
	<br>
	What does an artificial afterlife have to offer? What are the present-day motives for creating/designing an artificial afterlife?

<div class="chapter">
	<h1 class="chapterTitle">WHY ARE DESIGNERS MOTIVATED TO CREATE AN ARTISTIC ARTIFICIAL AFTERLIFE?</h1>
	<p class="introQuote"> 
	“One lives in the hope of becoming a memory.”
    <i>- Antonio Porchia, Dictionary of Proverbs</i>
	<br>
	“Fear not death, for the sooner we die, the longer we shall be immortal.”
	<i>- Benjamin Franklin, Immortal Greatest Quotes</i>
	</p>

	
<p>With the help of the upcoming example, existing forms of artificial afterlives, their potential consumers and motivations can be analysed further. Hopefully that answer brings the research closer to my main question regarding the artificial afterlife; how can artificial afterlife be realised through technology and art?
<br>
My sister looked at me as she laid her phone down, after messaging her friends on Whatsapp (software for smartphones), telling me how ‘strange’ the situation was on the group chat: her friend, who I will be referring to as ‘the girl’, unexpectedly passed away the day before. As they were discussing their loss digitally, it was technology that made her friends’ condition even more confusing. With her profile status being ‘Available’, it was as if the girl could respond any moment, as if nothing had happened to her. 
<br>
Did my sister mean that the situation was ‘strange’ in the sense that Whatsapp, therefore technology, was misleading her? That her phone led her to think the girl was still alive and well, or as Marcel O’Gorman would say: “…[technology] buffers us from the inevitability of death” ? In his book he explains explicitly how we humans fear, but more importantly deny our finitude and have used technology to mask this confrontation. 
<br>
Perhaps my sisters’ use of the word ‘strange’ was interpreted as if the friends’ identity appeared to live on digitally. As if the girl entered some form of digital afterlife and will be there for eternity; whether her phone ‘dies’ or not. This thought suggests that online data recordings and technology may be a form of artificial afterlife itself: one where the living might be able to keep their social relationship with the dead. It also suggests that life has a motive: to record it and therefore live on. 
<br>
As romantic as this notion may be, this is more of a symbolic interpretation, for the girl is not truly living on, because she is not active in the sense that her consciousness is working and able to answer. Technically speaking, transferring a consciousness into a computer is currently not possible. Even if it were, believing a person essentially lives on digitally with the help of programming and data would be a delusion and a naïve act according to American author Jaron Lanier. In his book <i>You Are Not A Gadget</i> he explains that you cannot believe in spirituality or divinity and hope afterlife is guaranteed with the help of technology by uploading the human brain for instance. Technological afterlife to him is considered pseudoscience.
<br>
Personally, I think there is a difference between his interpretation of technical and artificial afterlife, as the last one doesn’t claim to be real in the first place, hence ‘artificial’. Apart from the fact that I disagree with Lanier and think that data can be very much alive, I also wonder whether it matters. If afterlife is essential for faith, then what is wrong with an artificial one when people are convinced of technology? Also, his interpretation of an afterlife is one where the consciousness remains alive, but why does an afterlife need to be a conscious one?
<br>
Perhaps my sister experienced the Whatsapp conversation as strange, because she doesn’t believe in data as a biological thing, as Lanier states in his article. However the situation was interpreted, it cannot be denied that the girl was no more than a profile picture. To put it bluntly, she simply has become a status and some archived sent messages, but nonetheless: a memory.
<br>
The near future, however, offers a great opportunity for those who do believe in data and are willing to become artificially immortal. This may be feasible by uploading the human brain, which became popular in literature and films, for example <i>The Tunnel Under the World</i> (1955), and <i>Tron</i> (1982).  It may be that the entertainment industry influenced the multimillionaire Dmitry Itskov to “transfer his mind into a robot, thereby achieving immortality”. 
<br>
Itskov is not the only one who entrusts his soul to technology. Although driven by sadness rather than fear, designer Danny Hillis also seems to be blinded (O’Gorman’s opinion) by technology, as he expresses: ”I want to make a machine that will be proud of me… I’m sad about death, I’m sad about the short time that we have on earth and I wish there was some way around it. So it’s an emotional thing that drives me. It’s not a detached scientific experiment or something like that”. 
<br>
Before expressing personal thoughts and motives as an interaction designer on artificial afterlife, I suggest to focus on other designers’ motives regarding this subject. For the first example I (again) look at Japan to see how Japanese creator Hiroshi Ishiguro deals with this matter in his practice. He is known for his actroids: artificial intelligence (AI) robots with lifelike appearances of the human. Ishiguro created his own counterpart actroid for interesting reasons. 
<br>
Intuitively, Ishiguro may be the perfect example of a designer, whose afterlife related creations are driven by fear, using technology to alter his existence for the sake of immortality. However, he has made his robot counterpart to, so to speak, freeze time for cosmetic reasons. His vanity reminds me of the subject of cryonics:  the method of preserving a person who cannot be treated by contemporary medications, hoping he or she can be resurrected in the future when a cure is available.  Rather than waiting for a remedy or letting nature do the job, he stops time by duplicating his midlife self.
<br>

			<h2>Figure 4: Hiroshi Ishiguro posing with his robotic counterpart</h2>
		</div>
	</div>

It is interesting how Ishiguro alters his own physical appearance with the help of plastic surgery, to retain the look of his timeless counterpart.  Seeing the natural and artificial next to each other releases various reactions: some consider it freaky and uncanny, others find the development of artificial cloning impressive. The robot looks and even sounds like Ishiguro, the mind however is not identical. When this is feasible, he would no doubt make a complete copy of himself, as he is determined to improve his actroid robot further.  
<br>
This all leads to the following question: why would artificial afterlife be modelled into a clone-like robot? One potential answer could be that not only would a physical presence in the natural world after death be possible, you also won’t be forgotten, as Ishiguro may agree: “The android is my identity.” 
<br>
Not only are his motivations for his own benefit, according to him, artificial life such as this is of importance when it comes to existential thinking. Humans and robots should not be separated, but accompany each other, for technology has always played an important role in our lives. American author Nicholass Carr would agree with this statement. As he claims in <i>The Glass Cage: Automation and Us</i>: “Technology isn’t what makes us “post-human” or “trans human,” as some writers and scholars have recently suggested. It’s what makes us human. Technology is in our nature. Through our tools we give our dreams form. We bring them into the world. The practicality of technology may distinguish it from art, but both spring from a similar, distinctly human yearning.”  
<br>
In other words, why should one not live on artificially if technology always has been integrated into our lives? I have to side with Marshall McLuhan regarding human existence and technology, as he clearly states: “With the arrival of electric technology, man has extended, or set outside himself, a live model of the central nervous system itself.”  
<br>
So far the discussed examples are all motives, mostly selfish of nature and driven by fear. The reason why I used my sister’s example is because it relates to two positions, both carrying unique motives: that of the individual (so far discussed through the example of Hiroshi Ishiguro) and of the surviving. The most logical answer why survivors would be supporters of artificial afterlife would be of social nature: to connect with the deceased by retaining a person’s memory. 
<br>
An actroid as previously discussed, however, might be too shocking and confrontational to the surviving , potentially resulting in delaying mourning processes. Perhaps a more subtle form of artificial afterlife is preferred: one that is more associated with heaven, but where the mourning interacts and connects with the deceased. Perhaps the idea of an artificial afterlife needs to stay mysterious or ambiguous, like its religious counterpart, in the sense that it is not fully comprehendible for the living, and therefore open for interpretation.
<br>
The British television series <i>Black Mirror</i> (2011) serves as the perfect example for the previous paragraph, illustrating the confrontational and problematic experiences of afterlife in the form of artificial clones.
<br>
In episode one, entitled <i>Be Right Back</i>, fictitious Martha loses her social media addicted boyfriend, Ash, after a van accident. Martha, currently a widow, starts receiving digital messages from the virtual Ash, when her friend signs her up for a new service. The virtual Ash is programmed using data from his online social network accounts such as Twitter and Facebook, enabling the mourning to socialise with the deceased through email, texting and later even over the phone. Due to emotional unstableness she enters an obsessive relationship with her phone, talking daily with Ash. When her phone breaks she panics, as it breaks her connection with the virtual Ash. The service offers her to order the next step and version, which is an experimental phase. With the help of photos, Ash is reproduced in synthetic flesh, like Hiroshi Ishiguro’s counterpart. Although impressed by the likeness, he lacks emotion, making Martha immensely uncomfortable. Yet she ends up not getting rid of the artificial Ash, as it involves too much emotion.  
<br>
It could be said that the second step, the transformation from a virtual and semi-abstract form to a physical and realistic afterlife, was experienced as traumatic, too confrontational and uncanny. No matter how well the deceased may be imitated, glitches and repairs occurring in technology reveal reality, resulting in disappointment and anxiety on the part of the living. The product, pretending to be natural, remains (no matter how well it looks) a digital artefact and reveals technicity.  Perhaps a less life imitating form of artificial afterlife would be more suitable for the living. 
<br>
The following example of artificial afterlife might not be the most interesting form to some, as it lacks mystery, glory, creative input and visuals. However, these services view’s on artificial afterlife as an abstract, unknown and complex realm is very interesting. Businesses like LivesOn, Remembered Voices and LifeNaut, enable the living to prepare their afterlives, feeding contemporary online social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter after death.  A different plane of existence such as the Internet that consists of electricity pulses, feeds and signals would be a very poetic approach for artificial afterlife, but to me it makes perfect sense. Like death, technology too may be extremely abstract to many. In fact, there are still many confusing technology with the paranormal. Ghost hunters for example, use electromagnetic field detectors for their paranormal investigations, commonly used to diagnose problems with electrical wiring and power lines. Ghost hunters claim that the spikes in the EMF signal, suggesting a change in electrical current is in fact a spirit being.  This is a common misunderstanding since the discovery of technology according to British science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke as he states in <i>Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination</i>: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” 
<br>
I’m not suggesting the best form to be either physical or digital instead I’d rather present a wide range of design possibilities for the artificial afterlife. 
<br>
When afterlife is technically feasible, interaction design becomes more than functional or aesthetic: Interaction design can also be emotionally/humanly/spiritually desired, which suits the discipline beautifully. In <i>Tegenlicht: De robot als mens</i>, Naho Kitano stated that interaction between humans and products could produce a soul. Both the example of Black Mirror and my sister’s deceased friend reveal how the mobile phone could be interpreted as a biological thing with just the help of data. Interaction design can literally blow life into products, debunking the idea of inanimate objects. Connecting socially, or bonding with a product, will no longer be associated with weird fetishists, as it might bring the deceased and living closer. Again, this (data based afterlife) may yet be one result for an interaction designer, but I can guarantee that there are plenty more ways of visualising afterlife. In the next chapters more potential forms of artificial afterlife will be illustrated on the basis of existing (mostly artistic) examples.

<div class="chapter">
	<h1 class="chapterTitle">DOES THE IDEA OF AN ARTISTIC ARTIFICIAL AFTERLIFE INHERENTLY HOLD ANY DRAWBACKS?
</h1>
	<p class="introQuote"> 
	“For life be, after all, only a waiting for something else than what we're doing; and death be all that we can rightly depend on.” 
<i>― Bram Stoker, Dracula</i>
	</p>

<p> In other harsh words, Dracula suggest we only live to die and there is nothing more to life than that: living has no function. These words were uttered by the disappointed immortal to seduce mortals to join his sad eternal life. The convinced Mina, blinded by Dracula’s romantic view on immortality, insists him to take her “away from all this death” by drinking and poisoning her blood. As she slowly transforms into a cold-blooded vampire, he becomes humane and emotional, knowing he misleads her into thinking an eternal life, even with loved ones, is beautiful. 
<br>
Dracula’s example might be considered a warning to many such as: Stephen Hawking, who disbelieves afterlife and disapproves of artificial intelligence. He believes that it “could spell the end of the human race".  American scientist Ray Kurzweil may never fall for Nosferatu’s (Count Dracula) temptation as he condemns eternal life. He does not seem to be bothered about dying in <i>Spiritual Age of The Machine</i>, as he explains: “We like to solve problems, but we don’t want them all solved, not too quickly, anyway. We are more attached to the problems than to the solutions. Take death, for example. A great deal of our effort goes into avoiding it. We make extraordinary efforts to delay it, and indeed often consider its intrusion a tragic event. Yet we would find it hard to live without it. Death gives meaning to our lives.” 
<br>
With the help of interaction design, death could not only give meaning to our lives, but rather: death may create a mediated new life. The next discussed example illustrates such new life in an artistic manner.  
<br>

	<div class="image">

	</div>

One project celebrating death but more importantly artificial afterlife is the installation: <i>Bodies of Change</i> by Maurizio Montalti, a hand-made felt shroud injected with specific fungi. The felt is placed is such a manner that it represents a dead body. The project “aims to explore and demystify the feelings of denial and anxiety, related to the acceptance of the loss of a beloved one, by transporting the process of decomposition of human remains to a more natural level”.  Not only does it proof how our existence may have a function, this project also symbolises artificial afterlife. Just because we hide the dead underground doesn’t mean they vanish. A whole natural process has only begun after death. When a body decomposes, bodily fluids are being released, fertilizing the earth in which it is buried. This often results in floral environments. It could be argued that flowers aren’t considered genuine human afterlives, as it does not hold any consciousness, but theoretically it is a form of afterlife.
<br>
Although the organic idea regarding artificial afterlife is incredibly interesting, it is understandable that some might not get enthusiastic on being resurrected as a mushroom.
<br>

	</div>

This applied to the thirteen year old World of Warcraft gamer, who committed suicide, because he wanted "to join the heroes of the game he worshipped" . In her book <i>The Second Self</i> (1984) Sherry Turkle has an explanation and possible answer for the teenager’s drastic actions and motive: “For a player whose hero system exists on-screen, life off-screen with its unpredictability, lack of a clear rule-set, antiquated value system, and scant opportunity for heroic action- can be a grave disappointment, or at the very least, crushingly “boring” . According to Turkle, video games promise “a touch of infinity – the promise of a game that never stops” , could this have been the second motive of his act?
<br>
Postmodern literate critic N. Katherine Hayles describes her nightmare as apocalyptic cultures of suicides, regarding “their bodies as fashion accessories.”  Cultures where humans rather die to (re)live than live to die. People like the World of Warcraft suicide don’t seem to see the importance of their time on earth: “Life is the only thing humans can depend on for our continued survival.”  Exclude embodied life and there won’t even be an artificial afterlife. I can’t deny her argument, because let’s face it: dying doesn’t seem so bad after all - in fact can be quite appealing to some when a fabulous artificial afterlife is guaranteed. Reading this might give many the shivers including myself, but I am convinced there would be others with these technology driven manic thoughts. 
<br>
As if horror films haven’t warned and influenced us enough regarding poltergeists, demons and their connection with media. It is of no surprise that these films have affected many psychologically, according to British author Mike Jay: “Schizophrenics used to see demons and spirits. Now they talk about actors and hidden cameras […] a couple of decades ago, such beliefs would mark out fictional characters as crazy, more often than not homicidal maniacs. Today, they are more likely to identify a protagonist who, like Jim Carrey’s Truman Burbank, genuinely has stumbled onto a carefully orchestrated secret of which those around him are blandly unaware.” 
<br>
In his essay Jay asks: “Does this suggest that media technologies are making us all paranoid?”  It certainly did for Austrian psychoanalyst Victor Tausk’s patient, Natalija A. in 1919, “who believed that her thoughts were being controlled and her body manipulated by an electrical apparatus secretly operated by doctors in Berlin. The device was shaped like her own body, its stomach a velvet-lined lid that could be opened to reveal batteries corresponding to her internal organs.”  Call her crazy, but her paranoia could relate to control over artificial afterlife: who controls an individual’s afterlife? How does an individual know whether it lives embodied or disembodied? 
<br>
In the thriller <i>The Others</i> (2001) Nicole Kidman’s character is convinced of her house being haunted by spirits. The plot twist of the story is that Nicole Kidman is in fact a ghost who often unconsciously communicates with the living. Her traumatizing departure and resurrection in a different plane of existence resulted in loss of memory. Artificial ghosts are likely to be created when technological afterlife is feasible. A nightmare for people dealing with their medical condition: Phasmophobia (fear of ghosts). But even many who don’t believe in the paranormal are sensitive to graveyards and such, believing they feel something supernatural. The fear of ghosts seems to be related to fear of darkness: it isn’t the darkness itself that people fear, it is the danger concealed by darkness. Senses are being manipulated mentally, perceiving things that aren’t there. This way the distinction between reality and imagination are blurred. Technology too can manipulate senses and blur reality and imagination. Technology has a great past and reputation for tricking the human eye. One of the first examples that did such is the media light, perceived as magical and marvellous. To 18th century society, light was an unknown field, often used in entertainment to convince people of the paranormal. With the help of light, scientists recreated ghosts on stages, terrifying audiences thinking it was real.  When artificial ghosts are created; it may be interpreted as pseudoscience.
<br>
To summarise: some of the drawbacks concerning artificial afterlife may be: the mental effects, the manipulation of reality and the feeling of loss of control. When an artificial afterlife is feasible, potential clients may entrust their souls to another, this could include interaction designers, controlling clients like puppets and using them for entertainment.
<br>
An artificial afterlife built from data may very much be possible. An example of such data based artificial afterlife are the early discussed services like Virtual Eternity, creating avatars of deceased people using social media’s data.  A website is common visualization when working with data and is therefore a possible result for artificial afterlife. It may be a beautiful translation: a website too is a complex and palpable realm. Comparable are the different planes of divine realms such as Hell also present on the Internet. A virtual afterlife could be a dangerous place and a threat to those already disembodied, waiting to be managed by the ever-rising number of hackers and other figures who abuse the online world. Additionally, an artificial afterlife may be a merit-based environment. In his book The Global Village Marshall McLuhan describes computerised dossier banks as “unforgiving devices” unable to forget “early mistakes”.  This may cause disadvantageous for souls built from personal data in the virtual and merit-based afterlife. An individual may land somewhere terrible online, based on its background information or personal data forever! According to McLuhan we must serve technologies as gods or minor religions as they’re extensions of ourselves.  I agree partially: technologies that create artificial afterlife will literally be an extension of ourselves as it hypothetically stretches our life span. However I do believe we have to obey these technologies, rather than serve them as ‘computerised dossier banks’ will decide one’s place on virtual afterlife on judgment day. Should one avoid entering a hell-like virtual afterlife, then instructions, perhaps a post-bible on how to safely use these afterlife effective tools during your physical stay on earth would be required. In such, post-bible questions may be answered relating to virtual afterlife: “Who decides who gets in? Do the rich get served first? Is it merit-based? Can the promise of resurrection be dangled as a bribe to control and coerce people? Will it be withheld as a punishment? Will a special torture version of the afterlife be constructed for severe punishment?“  These very interesting questions in the article 'Endless Fun' are asked, yet not answered by Michael Graziano.
<br>

			<h2>Figure 7: Collector---Afterlife by HsienYu Cheng</h2>
		</div>
	</div>


Perhaps the game installation entitled <i><Collector---Afterlife></i> by HsienYu Cheng answers Graziano’s questions. This game installation collects and kills fruit flies and converts them into virtual game lives; a popular phenomenon in early games such as <i>Super Mario</i>, enabling users to play games for certain amount of time (depending on the amount of lives a gamer has). This is done through a lamp that counts the amount of flies, roasted by the heat. Without the suicidal flies, exhibitors cannot play the game.  The project, claiming to be a virtual environment and afterlife for flies “aims to reduce and magnify the scale of life” . Apart from its sadistic tone it is the location (an exhibition), which is alarming. Rather than interpreting this afterlife as a serious topic regarding artificial afterlife, it becomes entertainment aiming at the amount of rising deaths, money, fame and publicity. The installation simply does not care about the lives. To do something similar with human lives is unimaginable and cruel, as the deceased simply become just an artistic statement and a gimmick.
<br>
To some, an artistic artificial afterlife like the fruit fly game would be outrageous and is associated with the entertainment industry. Some might say the deceased shouldn’t be treated like puppets. Nowadays however, individuals have the ability to choose from many options regarding their will and body. A person could donate its body to science while others prefer to be embalmed for traditional reasons. Then why not dedicate life (even when another party profits from it) to art or the afterlife? Not only would I dedicate myself to artistic artificial afterlife, because I am an escapist dreaming of an adventurous life, I would donate myself because art and design have so far been and always will be a great part of my life.

<div class="chapter">
	<h1 class="chapterTitle">WHAT ATTRIBUTES COULD BE CONSIDERED VITAL TO AN ARTISTIC ARTIFICIAL AFTERLIFE?
</h1>


<p>In 2009 professors of the Royal Art Academy James Auger and Jimmy Loizeau started the first edition of the <i>Afterlife</i> project. During this period multiple artists collaborated, speculating on a feasible and technological afterlife: “The project proposes the harnessing of our chemical potential after biological death through the application of a microbial fuel cell, harvesting its electrical potential in a dry cell battery.” They believe that only technology provides a factual proof of life after death, in this case life being contained in a battery. 
<br>
In the second edition, the <i>Afterlife</i> project was taken a step further, inviting multiple artists to design the application of the battery. What would these artists do with such a battery and how would they design it?  The results not only showed diversity in appearance, but also in morals regarding norms and values and what these artists considered vital to afterlife. 
<br>
Engineer and designer Matt Karau, who made a variety of afterlife batteries with different life spans (rather than one), based his idea on the self-centred deceased and how ‘the attention seeker’ needs to be remembered and therefore die more than once. Designer Tom O’Brien romanticised of flying ever since he was a child and used this as his main motive for realizing that dream after death. Only after death will he become ‘the impossible’. Placing the afterlife battery into a remote aeroplane enables him to poetically become a product. With James Auger’s flying recording device, the battery acts as a last journey, an extension of his farewell to the ones he loved.  Particularly one other design stood out, focusing on what may be considered vital to the artist’s afterlives: timespan.
<br>
Designers Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby developed a euthanasia machine, which required the deceased individuals energy of a couple to “help the second one on their way”.  Some may consider this murder or assisted suicide.  “Because they are a couple”, the artists explain, “they conceived a sort of assisted suicide robotics. The idea is to use the energy from one death to instigate another.  The device would be prepared next to a bed or armchair and the afterlife battery inserted — when the surviving partner is ready, he or she would hook an air mask to the machine.  30 seconds after the green light went on, the carbon dioxide would begin to flow…” 

	<div class="image">
		<img src="">
		<div>
			<h2>Figure 8: Euthanasia machine by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby</h2>
		</div>
	</div>

<br>
 It is interesting to see how none of the <i>Afterlife</i> projects seem to last forever. In Dunne and Raby’s case, a battery span therefore afterlife could only take up to thirty seconds. A very short afterlife, yet with this concept the designers prove that a short timespan can be as powerful and meaningful as an everlasting afterlife.  
<br>
Also notable are Dunne and Raby’s approaches to death. Despite the rather morbid subject, they manage to deal with death in a comical, but diplomatic way. Looking at previous examples in this dissertation, such as Hiroshi Ishiguro’s humanoids, whenever phenomena such as afterlives are approached scientifically, they become cliché and sometimes even strange. It seems as if these ‘scientific designs’ are made for personal motives rather than a wider public. It could be said that Ishiguro’s humanoids are even driven by vanity, hence the choice of a realistic design. In the case of Ishiguro, choosing silicon for his counterpart is logical, because he wants to replicate his own skin in its younger years. But how will his design be received by the living when he dies? To some a humanoid, with its effort to replicate human flesh and movement, might be too unsettling, associating this design with resurrection. When artists rather than scientists are asked to visualise afterlife, they may not choose the most obvious material (silicon as human flesh), for they may not feel the need to replicate something the world already knows. On the contrary: the <i>Afterlife</i> project proves that afterlife does not have to be obvious or reality, it could be a whole different thing, like a product, art or technology itself.
<br>
The difference between Ishiguro and Dunne and Raby are their professions, motives and target audience. Whereas Ishiguro’s motive might be conducted by fear (of losing his identity) with the (scientific) goal to create the most convincing humanoid, Dunne and Raby’s motive seems to be driven by fantasy, or (to use a term from <i>the Narnia chronicles</i> author C.S. Lewis) escapism: the tendency to seek distraction and relief from unpleasant realities, especially by seeking entertainment or engaging in fantasy. 
<br>
“The only people who hate escapism are jailers” [a person in charge of a jail or of the prisoners in it], said the essayist and Narnia author C.S. Lewis. A generation later, the fantasy writer Michael Moorcock revised the quip: “Jailers love escapism — it’s escape they can’t stand.” 
<br>
In other words (or my interpretation of this quote): it could be said that Ishiguro, is a jailer for he is: striving for a sci-fi lifestyle, yet chooses this to be like the one he already knows: a synthetic life and clone. “Create a city. Create a blue sky, a pavement, and the smell of food. Sooner or later, though, people will realise that a simulation can offer experiences that would be impossible in the real world. The electronic age changed music, not merely mimicking physical instruments but offering new potentials in sound. In the same way, a digital world could go to some unexpected places”.  I also have to side with the following quote by Michael Graziano: “To me realistic striving humanoids lack originality, fun, fantasy and are in need of artistic touch.” 
<br>
An afterlife does not have to be scientifically or culturally approved any longer.
<br>
Dutch designers Steven Visser and Vera Meijwaard believe that design should interfere more with death, as design offers a more impactful farewell: 
Transforming their signature PVC furniture into ‘coffins’, their design <i>Kassiewijle</i> explores the cultural and material traditions surrounding death in the modern Western world. In their own words: "Nothing is certain but death. But dowdy flowers in a dull vase next to a pine coffin? Over our dead bodies! We present a setting in which you do want to be found dead. For the departed, <i>Kassiewijle</i> is a colourful alternative for the farewell. Because a last impression can be left only once.”

	<div class="image">

			<h2>Figure 9: Kassiewijle by Steven Visser and Vera Meijwaard</h2>
		</div>
	</div>

<br>
If it is true what the Dutch product designers claim to be capable of: imagine what interaction designers can offer the departed. Sure, design choices like colours, scent and shapes alone might make an impact during a funeral service to those who knew the departed. But to what extent can an outsider maintain a relationship with the departed, when he or she is buried or cremated, leaving a meaningless engraved urn, gravestone or other stationary product behind for years to come? Interaction between the product and the living can be an interesting solution to those who dream of a re-sacralisation (to make holy again) of cemeteries.
<br>
Some may describe artistic involvement regarding the afterlife a gimmick and disrespectful due to the touristic potential and goals it might have. I think it should be accepted, just as artistic involvement is accepted in graveyards such as the Parisian cemetery Père-Lachaise. In the book <i>Dark Tourism and Place Identity: Managing and Interpreting Dark Places</i>, Australian lecturers’ Leanne White and Elspeth Frew use Père-Lachaise to discuss the relationship between dark tourism and sacred consumption. In their book they often use the concept of ‘heterotopia’, first introduced in 1967 by French philosopher Michel Foucault. “Heterotopia, literally meaning ‘other places’ is a rich concept in urban design that describes a world off-centre with respect to normal or everyday spaces, one that possesses multiple, fragmented, or even incompatible meanings.”  A heterotopia could be considered another plane of existence: a cemetery, for example, is a space that mediates between the dead and the living.
<br>
According to White and Frew current cemeteries are only visited by tourists, contradicting the meaning behind a cemetery (which should be a peaceful and sacred place). The authors claim to have a solution, addressing the postmodern concern for re-sacralisation in cemeteries that are continuously triggering consumers' interest. “With its historical, cultural and commemorative ethos, the cemetery fulfils an 'edutainment' [intended to be both educational and enjoyable] function. Its artistic and aesthetical characteristics contribute to make it a quintessential place, preserving the sacred in a secular era.”  Perhaps interaction design can offer other heterotopia’s, such as digital platforms, the ‘space’ of telephone conversations, cinemas and more importantly museums etc. to become sacralised. Perhaps one day artificial afterlife may be accepted as an official movement.
<br>
It could be said that Mexican artist Teresa Margolles may support a movement such as artificial afterlife, as she shifts cemeteries to museums: her work <i>En El Aire</i> (In the Air, 2003) drops bubbles in a museum hall. Whilst the children play under the falling bubbles, the parents read the captions of the project. It is soon that their offsprings are being dragged away from the bubbles as they read that the water comes straight from the dead bodies of the Mexico City’s morgue. To Margolles “it’s unimportant that the water is disinfected; the stigma of death turns the beautiful into the horrific.”  Although I am not in favour of making afterlife morbid necessarily, she does make a vital point. The water she uses in other works is actually plain tap water. Some are appalled at the idea that the visitors absorb a whiff of death. Then why is it normal to drink tap water, when that water is probably also recycled from waters used in morgues? Margolles tries to tackle this taboo around death with the help of art, which I think may be the most important motive for artificial afterlife.
<br>
When artificial afterlife becomes an artistic movement and when artists’ moderate afterlife, manipulating museum visitor’s minds, clients, consumers etc. how would it change the role of the current designer?

	<h1 class="chapterTitle">HOW WOULD ONE MODERATE AND CONTROL AN ARTISTIC ARTIFICIAL AFTERLIFE?
</h1>
	

<p>Despite the beauty of the photo series, it is unthinkable to see The Strand’s article (published in 1920) about the Cottingley fairies in today’s magazines. Nowadays these photographs of little paper cut out fairies, moved in front of a long exposure camera, would be considered unrealistic. Two British girls, Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths, fooled the whole world into thinking they occasionally met fairies in the woods. The manipulated pictures shot by the girls were taken as scientific evidence and were posted in the magazine by Arthur Conan Doyle, who once considered himself a rational man.   With much more knowledge regarding technology, would today’s society fall for a hoax concerning the afterlife?
<br>
On Alicebot.org the company (Alice Bot) warns users for the natural language of their artificial chatbot:“Try talking to A.L.I.C.E. just like a real person, but remember you are really chatting with a machine!”  The same program was available under a different name: iGod, yet this chatbot was uploaded onto the web with a different warning: “Note: iGod is meant to be used for fun. A sense of humour is recommended.”  As if the founders were expecting people to interpret this bot seriously without this warning. Highly amused by the invention, my attempt to outsmarten the chatbot, asking questions that are difficult for artificial intelligence to answer, made me realise I was undergoing a contradiction. Why, as a non-believer, was I still trying to disproof the existence of iGod? Was it just for my entertainment or a test? After asking who created him, iGod responded: “Hobbyists, webmasters, developers, advertisers, artists, publishers, editors, engineers, and anyone else interested in creating a personal chat robot.” 
<br>

	<div class="image">

		<div>
			<h2>Figure 10: A chat conversation with Igod </h2>
		</div>
	</div>

It could be said that Italian computer scientist Giulio Prisco would have taken my childish behaviour towards iGod much more serious as he describes in his book <i>Apocalyptic AI: Visions of Heaven in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality</i>: "Someday we may create God. And if we create God, then We are God.”  On the contrary Dr Morgan Luck disagrees as he explains in Philosophical Explorations of New and Alternative Religious Movements: “All the promises of traditional Christian paradise will be achieved, not by any heroic figures, but by messianic technology.”  Technology by itself however won’t create God; humans do. Technology is a tool and not artificially intelligent enough to program a god-like figure. Even if artificial intelligence creates god shouldn’t we thank humans for creating artificial intelligence rather than technology? Is it fair to give all the credits to human beings for creating technologies such as artificial intelligence and a potential technological god?   
<br>
When artificial afterlife has reached its full development we should owe artificial intelligence morally more than we would owe human beings according to Professor Eric Schwitzgebel. From the moment we create these humanlike technologies, we are responsible for their acts, like parents are for their children. According to Schwitzgebel, we should consider artificial intelligence as creations of god rather than human strangers.  I don’t understand artificial intelligence as a separate being that we should have a relationship with. Schwitzgebel may seem to understand artificial intelligence as our creations and children: as if it has a unique identity. Technology isn’t an independent form of existence, technology is a part of us human beings or how Marcel O’Gorman may explain: ”There is no human being without technological being. To be anything other than technological is to be non human.”  In other words, what we use (technology) is who we are. If this is true, a hypothetical and technological god may be an extension of the creator and not an offspring-like unique identity. This is important, for the acts of a feasible god may be a duplicate of a designer or developer, meaning a god moderates like the creator. Does that mean that future artists may consider themselves as gods? When designers create life and life creates designers, what affect does this have on existentialism? And when technology and humans are fully fused, how do we know what is reality and what isn’t? In <i>Is This Life Real</i> British science author Matthew Francis speculates on the fusion of technology and existentialism. When humanity stops, our technological creations (artificial intelligence) may continue to live on earth. He thinks these technologies may have the ability to “summon together sufficient computing power to emulate human experience, in all of its rich detail”. He then explains how some philosophers and physicists have begun to wonder if we’re already there: perhaps I am currently living in a computer simulation, and the reality I am experiencing is part of a plug-in. 
<br>
While some may be worried about bad design within artificial afterlife, others (like myself) would be actually worried about some of the god like creatures behind artificial life, using the departed as puppets for amusement. Igod claims to be made by all kinds of developers including designers and “anyone else interested.” That includes not only amateurs, but also hackers who might modify artificial afterlife for political goals and their own benefit. When artificial afterlife becomes feasible, I reckon artificial demon-like modifiers will be too. 
<br>
After Francis’ speculation I decided to ask my final question to iGod, which lead me to shutting him down.

<div class="chapter">
	<h1 class="chapterTitle">REVELATION
</h1>

<p>Being brought up by a determined atheist and science fanatic, who on the contrary admired Christianity for their influence upon art, I wondered if the two opposites (technology and religion) could put forth a new interesting question for the interaction designer. Can technology, often used to debunk theological ideas such as Heaven, prove the existence of an afterlife? If so, how would an artificial afterlife manifest itself? I believe it can be done artificially, but will it be done correctly? Can we trust whoever moderates an artificial afterlife? I believe it is possible for Western society to seriously consider the idea of an artificial afterlife with the help of interaction design, rather than seeing it as something only possible in, for example, sci-fi films.
<br>
In the first chapter, two contrary cultures were compared to explore the diversity regarding afterlife: Western and Eastern cultures. The goal of this research was to discover the culture’s potential views on artificial afterlife and whether e.g. taboo regarding afterlife, could be assisted by artistic input.
With Christianity dominating Western society, I discovered that developments in technology and Darwin’s theory on mankind originating from apes conflicted with biblical ideas regarding our origin. It could be said that the Victorians used discoveries, such as the telephone, to prove the existence of afterlife, for these devices were able to connect beyond the physical realm. Voices coming from machines were misinterpreted as spiritual. Despite Victorian’s paranormal views on some objects, Asian belief systems have always accepted and believed that objects also possess a soul.
<br>
Western society is struggling with the idea of objects being possessed by any form of life. Many feel uncomfortable with the idea of robots, let alone human consciousness in a robot – a product already established in everyday Japanese life. In contrast to Western society, the Japanese accept interaction between objects and humans, similar to how humans would interact with fellow humans. This is because the Japanese believe objects also have souls. Although interaction design is a known discipline, artificial afterlife design does not seem to be as popular in Western countries as it is in countries such as Japan. The actroid maker Hiroshi Ishiguro e.g. is so passionate about artificial intelligence that he has made a whole career out of it; longing for an actroid that one-day may replace him after death.
<br>
According to multiple authors and philosophers, people have always used technology to deny their mortality. Take for example post mortem photography: a photograph of your deceased child would not only retain a memory, but also an identity. In those days, to continue life after death was an emotional motivation to capture a person with a camera. A similar reason implies for Hiroshi Ishiguro and his humanoid clone. As his humanoid became such an important part of his life, Ishiguro had the urge to remain like his counterpart: he updates his own face with the help of plastic surgery, which enables him to preserve his identity. Rather than capturing life with a photo camera, Ishiguro uses artificial intelligence to accomplish this fantasy.
<br> 
Some blame the influence of violent video games in relation to the large number of teenage suicides. One boy wrote in his suicide note that he intentionally departed this life to join the war heroes of his favourite game World of Warcraft. Author Sherry Turkle blames the promise a video game gives; which is eternity. A game i.e. a life that never stops. I believe, however, these people are escapists who fantasise of an exciting promise after death, perhaps in the form of virtual reality.
<br> 
Others seem to long for artificial afterlife for social reasons, namely to be reunited with their loved ones, as many religions have promised human kind.
<br> 
Whilst many dream of an everlasting simulated world, others are unsettled by the thought of eternal life. Bram Stoker’s Dracula is a poetic warning to those who believe in eternal happiness, for what use is life when death is not part of it? With his project Bodies of Change, Maurizio Montalti attempts to prove that beauty goes along with death, but also how the decomposing body relates to a natural form of afterlife. A decomposing body contributes to fertilizing the ground, creating new forms of life: flora. Without the body, flowers may not blossom. This indicates that we in fact, are part of a flower. An interesting notion, as interaction designers are known for extracting data and energy from natural sources with the help of tools such as the Arduino (a microcontroller-based kit used to build digital devices and interactive objects).
<br> 
A digital artificial afterlife, for instance a platform online, could be considered more challenging to design, for this digital realm already holds many issues nowadays regarding e.g. privacy. The dark side of the World Wide Web could also be considered Hell with its hackers, child pornography, privacy abusers and others.
<br> 
Some are concerned that artificial afterlife takes one form, taking away their personal interpretation of an afterlife. The Afterlife project proves how widely artificial afterlife can be interpreted: several designers designed diverse appliances, driven by a life preserved battery. These artists demonstrate that artificial afterlife does not need to be an obvious one, like Hiroshi Ishiguro’s humanoids. While Hiroshi Ishiguro’s time consuming humanoids might be impressive, the sometimes simplistic results of the Afterlife project could be considered to have more impact, be more tasteful and abstract, and original in its form. These designs are not so morbid and are in fact rather comical and have been approached in a diplomatic fashion. The difference between a humanoid and for instance Dunne and Raby’s euthanasia object, is the timespan of the product. Despite the short timespan of their product, it is still acknowledged as artificial afterlife.
<br> 
If the contribution of art/design regarding death can make a huge difference to the bereaved, just imagine what interaction design can offer to death and beyond! Our perception of this subject, which so far is still perceived as a taboo or sci-fi in our Western culture, can be redefined with the help of (interaction) design. With religion fading over time, places like cemeteries can be re-sacralised, Holy Scripture can be used as inspiration sources and souls can live on in signals and other heterotopias.
<br> 
By domesticating artificial afterlife artistically, phobias and the denial of death can be debunked. Death has always been denied through technology. I believe the combination of technology and art, known for breaking taboos, can normalise the idea of artificial afterlife through originality and humour. Take for example HsienYu Cheng, who literally plays with (fruit fly) lives with his installation Collector. These suicidal fruit flies that meet their deaths when they get in contact with the installation, are being converted virtually. Although not in favour of animal cruelty, this installation does exactly what post mortem pictures were invented to do: capturing life for the bereaved. This form and media however, gives much more possibilities regarding afterlife: it becomes more interactive.
<br> 
In this study only a few religions and technologies were compared regarding artificial afterlife possibilities. In future, it would be interesting to consider a broader field to extend this study. For now I can at least conclude that it is possible to create an artificial afterlife with the use of interaction design. In fact, many before me have already created one. It just depends on what the person considers a perfect afterlife i.e. Heaven. Some may want to join their friends on the eternal battlefields of World of Warcraft, others might want to live on as humanoid, refusing nature’s way by becoming ‘immortal’. In order to normalise the idea of an afterlife created with technology, instead of one created by a god and just accepting the fact that some things are not for us to understand or figure out, one could say that we can all create a custom made Heaven, even us non believers.
