<h1 class="chapterTitle">//PREFACE</h1>

<p>Let me start by asking you what your favourite subject was in school. Did you ace abstract division in maths, enjoy exploring the molecular world of chemistry? Maybe you thrived on consumer behaviour and supply-and-demand graphs in economics or loved letting your imagination run loose during history class.</p>

<p>My favourite subject, well that was definitely biology. Why? The answer is simple; I gained insight into the one thing I could relate to the most; human nature, to the mechanisms of my own body; to myself. For me there was no such thing as abstract in biology, a term I only understood within art, my other favourite subject. In art class I could shape and create a world with my own hands and during biology I could see the mechanism of a sheep’s heart I had dissected, remove the lens from a cow’s eye or view the cells of my hair through a microscope.</p>

<p>Physics on the other hand was my worst nightmare, especially when it came to forces. Yes, I understood the theory and principles laid down by Sir Isaac Newton himself. I knew that when I rode my bike up a hill I would not fall through the ground beneath me because the road exerted a force of normal (FN) upwards. I knew that if there was enough force of friction (FS), I would not slip. I can feel gravity (FZ)pulling me and my bike in the opposite direction, making every cycle harder than the first. Yet, when gravity gets the better of me and the forces which are supposed to keep me upright aren’t balanced, causing me to fall to the ground, I can hear the clatter of the fall hitting my ear drums. I can feel the pain it causes my body. I can see the blood leaking through my knee caps, its metallic smell filling my nose. With an X-ray doctors can see if I have broken any bones and with a blood test they can determine whether or not I have any internal bleeding</p>

<p>I can experience the effects of all the forces working upon me but I cannot smell them, touch them, taste them, hear them and most of all I cannot see them. Yet, when I was expected to understand the schematic drawings in which forces where represented by arrows pointing in so many different directions, I couldn’t help but question how I was to interpret and understand something I could not see or sense at all.</p>

<p>Now years later, after barely passing maths, physics and chemistry all together, I find myself facing a whole new level of misunderstanding of the unperceivable products of our modern network infrastructures They are forces once used by Steve Jobs to shock and awe his audience with back in 1999 at the historic Keynote Address when he demonstrated with a Hula Hoop that he could surf the web…wirelessly.<sup>1</sup> Since then the density of wireless devices has grown irreversibly, sadly though we are oblivious to the streams of data they emit. Not only are we ignorant as to what they look like, we are also unaware of where they are coming from, where they are going to and most of all we are ignorant to what effect that they have on us and our surroundings</p>

<p>So I ask myself, like I did back in high school years ago, but now as an Interaction Designer: how can we interpret, understand and interact with something we cannot sense?</p>

<h1 class="chapterTitle">//INTRODUCTION</h1>

<h3 class="chapterUndertitle">“I exist in life only if I can see.” <sup>2</sup> – Le Corbusier</h3>

<p>As an Interaction Designer the relationship between man and technology and the way in which it alters and shapes our society never fails to fascinate me; how one simple app such as Tinder has the power to redefine how people come into contact with each other. How mobile phones have given rise to a digital revolution in Africa enabling those without access to basic human needs such as running water and electricity to jump straight into the digital revolution of banking and business. <sup>3</sup> Now that we have entered the digital age in which we are globally connected, the choices and possibilities we are presented with seem to be endless. Yet the Calvinistic modern man remains hungry for better, faster and more sophisticated technology to improve his own and our industry’s efficiency and productivity. As the American media theorist Douglas Rushkoff explains in his book <i>Present Shock: When Everything Happen Now</i> (2013) “instead of offloading our time-intensive tasks to our machines,” our machines are the ones who are leading the pace. <sup>4</sup> The thousands of fanatics who camp outside of Apple stores across the globe in order to be the first to get their hands on the latest, forever evolving iPhone model reflect the near religious shape our relationship with technology has taken on. Why is it though that we seem to fear a Matrix-like future in which technology will take over from humanity? This schizophrenic relationship we have with technology is illustrated by Juhani Pallasmaa who says that “humans are both master and slave to the technium.” However, I beg to differ with the Finnish architect and author of the book <i>The Eyes of the Skin – Architecture and the Senses</i> (2012) when he states that “our fate is to remain in this uncomfortable dual role.” <sup>5</sup></p>

<p>During the course of this paper I will question our conflict-of-interest affair with technology by discussing and elaborating on the different theories offered by authors, philosophers and critics such as Pallasmaa, Rushkoff, Lissa Robberts, Marshall McLuhan, Mark B.N. Hansen, Peter Paul Verbeek, Bas Heijne and Adam Greenfield. I aim to explore how technology, whose development was once shaped by the human desire to expand our sensory capacities, has reversed into shaping our environment and the way we perceive and interact with our surroundings by delving into the theory of Technological Determinism. I will examine how this has put our direct engagement with the world through our other senses such smell, sound and touch at stake by researching the origins of Ocularcentrism; how has our industry privileged the domain of vision with inventions such as the printing press? I will illustrate how this favouritism towards the image has failed to manifest itself in the translation of what Mark Rolston, the cofounder and chief creative officer of Argodesign describes in his article ‘The Next Era of Designers Will Use Data As Their Medium’ (2014) as the “expanding array of experiences driven by machines that are essentially hidden from the user.” <sup>6</sup> These are processes which take place in the symbolic clouds of our devices, the invisible wireless networks which saturate the air and the silent algorithms which live on our personal data. In his book <i>The Filter Bubble: What the Internet is Hiding from You (2011)</i> the American Internet activist Eli Pariser argues how these algorithms minimize our intake of information online and therefore the ability to learn. <sup>7</sup></p>

<p>Why is it that we criticize media censure and fend for political transparency and virtual freedom within our digital platforms, but we seem less concerned about the physical limitations which our technologies can pose upon us?</p>

<p>Throughout my paper I aim to explore in what ways technology, which we have literally led into our lives blindly, affects our existential experience of reality and suppresses what makes us essentially human. What does it means to be human in a real-time, digitally networked, information age?</p>

<p>From the perspective of an Interaction Designer I will stress the significance of humanizing our experiences with technology and what role the artist plays in opening up the occult systems of ubiquitous computing. In many ways I believe that art acts as a mirror of the developments and thoughts of the people in a society at any given time; the reoccurring cycle of movements and counter movements throughout the history of art reflect the critical nature of artists and their ability to create new perspectives.Therefore, throughout each chapter I will tend towards art and design as a way of exploring the possibilities for re-involving our suppressed senses such as smell, sound and touch in our ocularcentric and technologically opaque society by asking the following questions which are essential to the lines of this paper:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can designers contribute towards a world in which the ocular bias makes way for olfactory, sonic and tactile sensing?</li>
<li>With what methods can designers demystify and reveal the hidden processes of ubiquitous computing in our urban landscapes?</li>
</ul>

<p>By asking these questions I aim to find different solutions for humanizing, embracing and changing our attitude towards technology. In turn I believe this will alleviate our fear towards the future implications of our own inventions.</p>

<p><h3 class="introductionH3"><b>IN THE 1ST CHAPTER</b></h3> - <i>The Blind Ocularcentric Society</i> - I will explore to what extent technology determines how we lead our lives by studying the writing of Marshall McLuhan, Lissa Roberts and Douglas Rushkoff and research the theory of Technological Determinism.I will illustrate how this development has led to the ocular bias of our society by diving into the history of ocularcentrism and how this has contributed towards the suppression of our non-ocular senses. What are the problems that we face when our senses are neglected and can we reintroduce smell, touch and sound to reveal the hidden infrastructures of our networked society?</p>

<p><h3 class="introductionH3"><b>IN THE 2ND CHAPTER</b></h3> - <i>The Reintroduction of Sensing</i> - the focus is on olfactory sensing and which characteristics of smell can be implemented in design. We will see how Amy Radcliffe makes use of a smell’s ability to bring back memories with her scent camera <i>The Madeleine</i> (2013); how does she challenge the contemporary visual methods for preserving history? I shall also introduce you to the world’s most famous scent designer Sissel Tolaas who has dedicated her career to raising awareness for the supressed nose and look into how she uses scent as an educational tool for communicating. Finally, in the search for a solution of the (emotional) hollowness of digital media I will look at how Leanne Wijnsma and Froukje Tan reintroduce the sense of smell as an instinctive danger sensor in the Internet realm in <i>The Smell of Data</i> (2015).</p>

<p><h3 class="introductionH3"><b>IN THE 3RD CHAPTER</b></h3> - <i>Smart Sensing</i> - I will adopt Pallasmaa’s and Marc Augé’s words in order to explain how the Industrial Revolution has given shape to both sensuously and socially deprived urban landscapes. We will discover how Augé’s theory of the non-place can be linked to Pariser’s Filter-Bubble-theory. I will argue how Pallasmaa’s definition of “architectural autism” can be redefined with the opaqueness of network signals and data streams which saturate our urban landscapes. In this chapter we will study Mark B.N. Hansen’s ideas of how sensing can be mediated through the sensors of smart technologies. With examples such as <i>Light Painting Wi-Fi</i>(2011) by Timo Arnall Jørn Knutsen and Einar Sneve or <i>The Architecture of Radio</i> (2015) by Richard Vijgen we will look at how designers have made use of the technology which emits and receives signals in order to translate them into something perceivable. Finally we will look at how ‘smart sensing’ can also partake in the translation of data into non-visual, sonic output with Frank Swain’s <i>Phantom Terrains</i> (2014).</p>

<p><h3 class="introductionH3"><b>IN THE 4TH AND FINAL CHAPTER</b></h3> - <i>Ritual Sensing</i> - I will depart from Peter Paul Verbeek’s theory that human beings are destined to survive with the tools they create and how, with the “ethics of technological mediation“, designers can contribute towards a paradigm shift in our attitude towards technology. <sup>8</sup> In this chapter I seek to find out whether we must follow the Japanese trend and equip our devices with genuine human interfaces or if designers must “help deliver a world where interfaces get out of the way“ and void from computer-like affordances as Rolston explains. <sup>9</sup> For an example of the latter we will look at Penny Webb’s <i>Separate Togetherness</i> (2015) with which she aims to "[…] escape as much as possible from what we perceive as 'technological objects,” by augmenting the sense of touch. <sup>10</sup> I will share Rushkoff’s vision on how our technologies distract us from living in the now and how mindfulness can contribute towards finding a balance between freedom and determination within our interaction with our devices. I will do this by discussing one of my own interactive projects, <i>Conductive Ritual</i> (2015), which is based on the idea that humans can only interact with their devices subsequent to a ritual ceremony as a rite of passage. By discussing my own work I hope to provide other designers with my idea of what role they can play in manifesting a new type of relationship between man and technology based on a give-and-and-take, balanced symbiosis in stead of letting our asynchronicity with technology run its natural course.</p>

<h1 class="chapterTitle">//1. THE BLIND OCULARCENTIC SOCIETY</h1>

<h3 class="chapterUndertitle">“IT IS BY NOW CLEAR THAT OVER THE LAST DECADE A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON EARTH, IN THE DEVELOPED AND THE DEVELOPING WORLD BOTH HAVE EMBRACED THE DIGITAL MEDIATION OF EVERYDAY LIFE, TO SUCH A FEROCIOUS EXTENT THAT IT CAN ALREADY BE DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER HOW WE EVER GOT THROUGH OUR DAYS WITHOUT THE NETWORKED THINGS AROUND US.” – ADAM GREENFIELD <sup>11</sup></h3>

<p>During the fourth episode of the Dutch documental series <i>De Volmaakte Mens</i> (the perfect human) the Dutch columnist Bas Heijne shares his concern for a future in which humanity becomes endangered by immersive technology. He meets up with Peter Paul Verbeek, a Dutch Professor of Philosophy at the University of Twente and asks him whether we must simply accept the manner in which technology impacts our lives. <sup>12</sup></p>

<p>According to Kurzweil’s Law of Acceleration, technological advancements will continue to increase exponentially until we reach a point at which human intelligence will be surpassed and technology will take over from humanity. This is also reffered to as ‘technological singularity’. Verbeek refutes this idea by reassuring Heijne that it is within our nature and doctrine of progress to invent tools with which we can accomplish more or ‘extend our bodies’ as media theorist Marshall McLuhan (1911-1980) wrote in his highly influential book <i>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</i> (1964). <sup>13</sup> According to McLuhan “[…] all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed.” This fascination with speed and progress excelled during the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century and has continued to develop in our contemporary society. The founder of Urbanscale and one of the world’s foremost thinkers on the interaction between ubiquitous computing and the urban place Adam Greenfield writes in the article ‘Digital Cities: Words on the Street’: “[…] without necessarily considering the matter with any particular care, as individuals or societies, we have installed devices in our clothing, our buildings, our vehicles and our tools which register, collect and transmit extraordinary volumes of data, and we share this data with the global network in real time.” McLuhan had predicted this mindless implementation back in 1964 and thus, as forward thinking as he was, he justified the importance of his book when he stated that “the stakes are very high and the need to understand the effects of the extensions of man becomes more urgent by the hour.” <sup>14, 15</sup></p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINISM</h2>
<p>As a Technological Determinist under the German philosopher and sociologist Karl Marx (1818-1883), McLuhan and his fellow determinists believed that technology is the main catalyst of social change and the primary influence on human social relations and organizational structures. According to their theory, a device’s design has the tendency to dictate its user's behaviour and consequently diminishing human agency. <sup>16</sup></p> 

<p>In her article ‘The Death of the Sensuous Chemist: The ‘New’ Chemistry and the Transformation of Sensuous Technology’ (1995), Lissa Roberts gives an example of this phenomena by explaining how the field of chemistry has transformed due to the introduction of advanced laboratory equipment in the 18th century. <sup>17</sup> While she applauds the spike in the precision of analytical investigations, the Dutch Professor of Science and Technology at the University of Twente says that with the desire of the human race to increase productivity with machinery, came an increase in our “destructive capacities”: “As the century drew to a close, chemists increasingly subordinated their bodies to the material technology of their laboratories and began erasing the presence of direct sensory evidence from the public records of their discipline’s literary and social technologies.” <sup>18</sup> In other words: we only face the world by means of our instruments which determines the way in which deploy our senses. <sup>19</sup> How has this phenomena developed itself nearly two hundred years later now that these ‘instruments’ have become a ubiquitous part of our lives? To what extent has and are our extensions withholding us from resorting to our human senses as with the chemists back in the 18th century? In what way is technology shaping the way we experience and interact with our surroundings?</p>

<p>Rushkoff’s book is essentially focussed on the latter as he specifically analyses how technology defines our experience of time and space. He illustrates how according to him our biological rhythms are being dictated and disrupted by technology, but also on how we are being forced into dividing our attention between our virtual and physical realities. <sup>20</sup> We are lead to believe that the choices our devices present us with provide us with more freedom, yet he writes that “all these interruptions, more than simply depleting our cognitive abilities, create the sense that we need to keep up with their impossible pace lest we lose touch with the present.” <sup>21</sup> Not only have we become asynchronized with time and space; during his presentation at the Transmediale Festival in Berlin in 2011, Mark B.N. Hansen, a Professor of Literature and Director of Undergraduate Studies at Duke University argues that computational processes are no longer synchronized to human experience. We have grown to become completely unaware of the mechanisms of the systems which condition our behaviour, or as Rushkoff says: “Our rhythms are dictated by the pulses of required inputs and incoming data.” <sup>21</sup></p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">OCULARCENTRIC SOCIETY</h2>

<p>Roberts is not alone in her stance that the instruments by which we aim to experience the imperceptible and enhance ourselves with, have influenced our sensuous experience of the world. During my research I have come across the writings of many other philosophers, theorists and authors such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Amira Mittermeier, Donncha Kavanagh, Martin Jay and also Pallasmaa. They share a mutual feeling of mourning due to the loss of multi-sensory design caused by the industry’s visual bias, also referred to as the 'ocularcentric paradigm'. Both the intellectual historian, professor and author of <i>Downcast Eyes: The Denigration of Vision in Twentieth-Century French Thought</i> Martin Jay and Pallasmaa attribute inventions such as the printing press<sup>*</sup> and photography as the catalysts in establishing our contemporary vision-centred culture: “The hegemony of vision has been reinforced in our time by a multitude of technological inventions and the endless multiplication and production of images – ‘an unending rainfall of images'.” <sup>23, 24</sup> As Pallasmaa’s quote suggests, this favouritism towards our eye’s function can be traced all the way back to ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Descartes and Heraclitus who all considered sight to be the noblest of the senses. <sup>25</sup> In the article ‘Ocularcentrism and its Others: A Framework for Metatheoretical Analysis’ (2004), Donncha Kavanagh, a Professor of Information & Organization at the University College in Dublin explains how Heraclitus believed that “the eyes are more exact witnesses than the ears”. Also, Plato believed that vision is humanity’s greatest gift as he stated that everything in the intelligible domain “can only be seen with the eye of the mind”. This reflects the importance of vision in his interpretation of truth and knowledge. <sup>26</sup></p>

<p>Today ocularcentrism has manifested itself in nearly every aspect of our lives and is at the base of the interaction with our technological extensions. We mediate the news, social interaction, consumerism and education through the pixels of their interfaces.The lit-up faces of people staring at screens is a common sight and the sound of magazine pages being turned and buttons being pressed has been replaced with the silence of scrolling and swiping. As stated gracefully by Pallasmaa: “[…] the incredible acceleration of speed during the last century has collapsed time into the flat screen of the present, upon which the simultaneity of the world is projected.” Both Pallasmaa and Rushkoff mention how our products are designed to be pleasing to the eye, yet their shape and materials hide their mechanism and age. In addition to this, consumer products are slowly being pushed aside by digital services such as Netflix, Spotify and social media channels, stripping them from any form of tactility. Pallasmaa writes that this development “has left the body and the other senses, as well as our memories, imagination and dreams, homeless.” <sup>27</sup></p> 

<h2 class="paragraphH2">NEGLECTED SENSES</h2>

<p>What are the problems that arise from neglecting our non-visual organs? One can imagine that our senses need to be trained in the same way we train our muscles; if we solely utilize one particular sense, then our remaining senses will become weak. However, as an Interaction Designer I am less interested in the physical consequences of supressing our non-visual senses. In stead I am more sympathetic towards the way in which this development puts our participation with the world at stake. You see, there are two sides to this story: for one: the neglection of our sense of smell, hearing and touch, but also the overload of the visual domain. In chapter 4 Frank Swain, the creator of <i>Phantom Terrains</i>, explains how this is one of reason the Google Glass failed to catch on. Instead of our eyes, he believes that our ears are a better fit for tuning into the invisible data structures of networked cities. <sup>28</sup> In an age where we are oblivious to the data streams of ubiquitous computing to me, and hopefully to other designers as well, the interesting aspect of this sensuous neglect has more to do with the potential of the supressed senses. As our eyes are simply doing overtime, our focus should be on training our non-visual senses.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier in the introduction, each chapter of this paper is directed towards a particular sense in combination with a method for sensing. How these senses have come to be neglected will be explored in these sections. What characteristics of our alternative senses lend themselves as tools for the humanization of our experiences with technology in response to the complexity of modern systems and allow us to use and experience technology in a more natural, instinctive way?</p>

<h1 class="chapterTitle">//2. THE REINTRODUCTION OF SENSING</h1>

<h3 class="chapterUndertitle">“SMELL IS THE MOST PALPABLE OF THE SENSES, BUT POSSESSES MORE MYSTIQUE: THE INVISIBLE IS TOUCHING YOU. YET IT IS, COMPARABLY SPEAKING, VIRGIN TERRITORY FOR AESTHETIC EXPERIMENTATION. - STEPHEN FORTUNE – DAZED” <sup>29</sup></h3> 

<p>Before the introduction of visual reproduction such as writing, printing and photography, memories were preserved by what Joshua Meyrowitz, Professor of Communications at the University of New Hampshire in Durham refers to as a “living storage system.” <sup>30</sup> In his article ‘Media Evolution and Cultural Change’ (2010) he explains how a culture’s history and philosophy were passed on by means of a biological delivery process which included rhythmic poetry and mythic narratives accompanied by ritual embodiment such as song and dance. <sup>31</sup> Now, with the omnipresence of cameras and the endless multiplication, production and distribution of images accompanied by the desire to maintain our virtual identity we have constituted ”a form of electronic panoptica.” <sup>32</sup></p> 

<h2 class="paragraphH2">THE MADELEINE</h2>

<p>According to Amy Radcliffe, a graduate from Central Saint Martins in London, “our entire existence is flattened into a scrolling feed of frozen frames”.<sup>33</sup> In an interview with <i>Disegno Daily</i> she says that the unending rainfall of images by which we archive our memories motivated her into investigating alternative ways for capturing and preserving our passed recollections in the digital age: “We take pictures of everything and load them online, where they’re infinitely replicable.” <sup>34</sup> She speculated about a future in which memories can be preserved with olfaction by creating an odour camera based on a technique by the Swiss fragrance chemist Roman Kaiser also known as Headspace Capture. <sup>35</sup> Placed in the globe the camera records the molecular information of an object’s smell by sucking the air into in odour trap made of a porous polymer resin. The result is a chemical formula which is used to artificially recreate the smell in liquid form: "It could be anything from the smell of your old house to sniff when you're feeling homesick, to the scent of a missed relative or partner," says Radcliffe. <sup>36</sup></p>

<p>What characteristics of smell though makes this sense an interesting alternative for the preservation of our memories? The name of the Radcliffe’s odour camera, <i>the Madeleine</i> (see fig. 1), says it all as it hints towards the book of the French novelist Marcel Proust, <i>À la Recherche du Temps Perdu</i> (In search of lost time). The story is of a man (Proust himself) whose long forgotten memories of his youth come to surface when he bites into a French madeleine cake dipped in tea thus illustrating what is known today as the ‘Proustian phenomenon’. <sup>37</sup> In the article ‘De geur van vroeger’ (the smell of the past) from the Dutch newspaper <i>De Volkskrant</i>, Ianthe Sahadat explains how The Proustian phenomenon suggests that smells are directly linked to our emotions as they have the ability to recall distant and involuntary memories. <sup>38</sup> Pallasmaa too mentions this effect when he states that “a particular smell makes us unknowingly re-enter a space completely forgotten by the retinal memory; the nostrils awaken a forgotten image, and we are enticed to enter a vivid daydream. The nose makes the eyes remember.” <sup>39</sup></p>

<p>Now, half a century later, it has been confirmed by neuroscientists that our sense of smell is in fact the only sensory modality directly linked to the amygdalae; the parts of the brain that process memories and emotional reactions. <sup>40</sup> In addition to questioning our contemporary visual methods for the preservation of history, Radcliffe justifies her choice of an olfactory design by pointing out that, like taste, smell is a sense which we aren’t yet able to reproduce digitally or as Stephen Fortune, media artist and technology writer at <i>Dazed Digital</i> puts it: “Only smell and taste have yet to feel the full transformative force of “cut it, paste it, quick – rewrite it” digitization”. <sup>41</sup> Hence the untouched territory of smell presents itself as an interesting field for designers to research beyond its ability to circumvent consciousness and ignite long historic events. So I ask the following question: how can we grant our sense of with a more conscious and functional role in our daily lives?</p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">TRAINING THE NOSE</h2>

<p>It is this question, which the Norwegian scent artist Sissel Tolaas asks herself and others every day and has dedicated her career to the mysterious realm of olfactory. For the past twenty years she has filled her studio in Berlin with over 7000 airtight jars of collected matter ranging from chunks of dried fish and rotten bananas to a series of armpit odours for the sole purpose of reproducing scents and bringing more attention to the nose. If you were to ask Tolaas, she would tell you that our nose is an undervalued organ in this day and age. <sup>42</sup> She cannot wrap her head around the fact that that there is a lower sense of empathy towards those who suffer from anosmia, the inability to smell, whereas the opposite is true for the blind and the deaf. In an interview with <i>The New York Times</i> by Susie Rushton Tolaas calls our Western society is “smell-blinded”: we are insensible to our unique bodily odours and therefore ignorant to what they communicate. <sup>43</sup> “I think that tolerance is what we’re missing. We live in a world that’s deodorized, pasteurized, and sterilized for your protection and, by doing so, we miss out on so much more information. <sup>44</sup> ”With her odour systems and installations she reassigns our nose as the main organ for communication and doing so she has attracted companies such as Adidas, Comme des Garçons, Cartier and IKEA, but also educational and medical causes such as Charité Medical Universities in Berlin, Harvard, the Liszt Center at MIT and the Max Planck Institute and museums such as the MoMA in New York, Tate Gallery, the National Art Museum of China and the Venice Biennale. <sup>45</sup></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Like Radcliffe, Tolaas embraces the emotional and nostalgic value of smells, but where <i>The Madeleine</i> is limited to that what fits into its globe to produce personalized scent memories, Tolaas’ work emphasizes our sensory deficiency by presenting us with intimate and informative olfactory experiences through embodiment. She aims to increase scent awareness, expand tolerance and emotional intuition by tweaking cultural prejudices towards smells through the exploration of real scents like body odours and city fumes. “A deeper understanding of the sense of smell is important in order to be more conscious of the possibilities it offers and its powerful capacity. Smell can empower vision and sound or, in contrast, create new meanings, conveying meaning on its own.” <sup>46</sup> She asked herself whether people can engage with their environment and orientate themselves by ways of smell and so she travelled to worldly cities such as Paris, Stockholm, Detroit, Kansas City, Calcutta Cape Town and Istanbul to create ethnographic and psychogeography smell scapes for each city. In an interview with Devon Walsh for <i>Swallow Magazine</i> she shares her experience of her trip to Mexico city where she was most intrigued by its citizens’ tolerance towards smell and especially the smell of pollution. <sup>47</sup> It made her wonder whether she could assess the problem concerning these fumes by making the inhabitants more aware of pollution through their nose. Can smell “[…] help people understand that they are often the cause of pollution.” <sup>48</sup> Another example of one of her scent infographics is “Berlin, city smell research”, a map with specific perfumes for each of Berlin characteristic districts, which she created for the Berlin Modern Art Biennale in 2004. In her interview with Fortune she explains that in order to capture the smell of East Berlin she removed concrete from the wall of the Jannowitzbrücke’s U-Bahn station, which has never been renovated after the Cold War. “Some of the people with me from Die Zeit newspaper started to cry – they were like, ‘This is East Berlin!’.” <sup>49</sup></p>

<p>Her work portrays the ability of smell to evoke strong emotions much like Proust’s’ involuntary memories. In 2006 she created a life size scratch ‘n’ sniff wall for the <i>FEAR of Smell — the Smell of FEAR</i> (see fig.4) at MIT's List Visual Arts Centre, a wall that, when touched, engages the visitors with the smell of perspiring, anxious men. <sup>50,51</sup> The scent artist covered the wall with paint she infused with the sweat from men who suffer from chronic fear. Tolaas was extremely moved when a 90-year-old visitor was brought to tears after he smelt the wall; “It was the closest the man had come to smelling real human scents in decades.” Still, it was <i>the Smell of World War I</i> smell scape which she personally described as “[…] so disgusting that I ended up shocking myself and everyone else who smelled it”. <sup>52</sup> She gave the visitors of the German Military Museum in Dresden the opportunity to literally smell history and offering them the slightest hint of the living conditions in the trenches by recreating the stench of horse carcasses, mustard gas, earth, wounds and blood.</p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">THE SMELL OF DATA</h2>

<p>Yet, however provocative and informative Tolaas’ projects are into stimulating us to use our nose in order to read and react to our environment, I remain in search of a compelling solution for the emotional hollowness of digital media. Can a Tolaasian, embodied approach be implemented to create more natural, digital environments? I ask this because I was struck by something Tolaas said during another interview with Fortune. <sup>53</sup> When the US military approached her for a collaboration to develop a method for soldiers to be able to literally ‘smell’ terrorists, the scent designer refused saying that “it is a line which I don’t cross.” <sup>54</sup> So, in the light of humanizing digital experiences and unveiling the invisible products of our digital networks and online behaviour, can smell, "the sense we react to most instinctively” as Radcliffe describes it, contribute towards making our digital experiences more ‘natural’? It was the Dutch graphic designer Leanne Wijnsma and filmmaker Froukje Tan who asked themselves a more specific question: how can we benefit from our nose as an instinctive danger sensor within ubiquitous computing? <sup>55, 56</sup></p>

<p>Feeling inspired by Ethanethiol, a substance which was added to gas after the New London gas explosion in 1937 to function as a warning signal for gas leaks, the duo initiated <i>The Smell of Design</i>(2015).Together with Greenhost, the two aim to revive the nose as a primary instinct for survival in their campaign for safer Internet environments. <sup>57</sup> Wijnsma, also known for the tunnels she digs in order to escape from the connected world, says that “[…] our sense of smell has helped early humans to survive. We used to trace our prey and it warned us in case of danger. Our nose was the watchdog of our senses. But since then our hunting and gathering has moved to the Internet”. <sup>58, 59</sup> By hunting and gathering Wijnsma refers to the data mining that takes place in digital spaces, something we are too often unaware of. She believes that we are ignorant to the potential danger the authorities pose to our personal data we create online as “[…] we don’t directly feel the danger”.</p>

<p>The project shall be presented by means of a movie, but we are yet to find out whether the duo have come up with a design proposal which reveals the physical outcome for this speculative, yet plausible solution. Can the realisation of <i>The Smell of Design</i> as an instinctive mechanism to defend yourself against data leeches be as simple as enriching the once odourless gas with a smell to alert people of gas leakages? Will it take on an a Google-Glass-inspired olfactory shape or should our data-emmiting devices be equipped with perfume dispensers? from now on? Even so, how will we know what the source of the danger is and how to protect ourselves from it? For now Tan and Wijnsma leave this up to our imagination, but despite these unanswered questions, their idea to implement smell as an instinctive caution sensor to unveil the imperceptible data structures may be a small, or maybe even a significant step towards increasing our communication with (and not only through) computing. It illustrates a future in which, as Bas Heijne addresses in <i>De Volkmaakte Mens</i>, we may no longer have to worry about technology supressing what makes us essentialy human. Eventhough the projects which have been analysed in this chapter are focussed on olfactory sensing, one can imagine that the implementation of other senses in digital environments can offer a solution for the asynchronicity with our technological extensions Hansen spoke of earlier on in the introduction.</p>

<h1 class="chapterTitle">//3.SMART SENSING</h1>

<h3 class="chapterUndertitle">“WHAT INNOVATION COULD POSSIBLY BE SO FUNDAMENTAL THAT IT WOULD COMPEL US TO RETHINK SOMETHING SO DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN CULTURE, AND SO HARD TO ALTER, AS THE WAY WE MAKE CITIES - ADAM GREENFIELD <sup>60</sup></h3>

<p>My parents are the type of people who are always rethinking, transforming and decorating their house. If they haven’t purchased a whole new set of furniture, they are adding an extra room to the back of the house, extending the bathroom into the spare bedroom or completely renovating the kitchen to their heart’s content. For many years now they have been wanting to extend the roof of their bedroom with a dormer window. Sadly though the town’s aesthetics committee has never granted them with permission to do so; the alterations would disrupt the aerial of our town. Their case made me think of Pallasmaa who argues that our ability to view cities from above has played its part in determining the shape of our urban landscapes when he writes: “With equal clarity, the visual paradigm is the prevailing condition in city planning, from the idealised town plans of the Renaissance to the Functionalist principles of zoning and planning that reflect the ‘hygiene of the optical’ […] city plans are highly idealised and schematised visions seen through ‘le regard surplombant’ (the look from above), as defined by Jean Starobinski, or through ‘the mind’s eye’ of Plato.” <sup>61</sup></p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">ARCHITECTUAL AUTISM</h2>

<p>The ocularcentric paradigm has oozed its way into our architectural structures, robbing them of their sense of materiality and hapticity. It has polluted the streets with what Pallasmaa also refers to as “architectural autism.” <sup>62</sup> Not only have we manufactured urban landscapes in which we are no longer stimulated to be sensuously curious, in his book <i>Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity</i> (1995) the French anthropologist Marc Augé illustrates how with the speed and motorisation of the Industrial Revolution came the expansion of the travel industry. <sup>63</sup> By indulging into our desire to extend ourselves in time and space, Augé believes we have been elevated us into a state of “supermodernity” defined by the excess time, space and individuality. He explains how this sense of excess has given rise to temporary spaces for passage such as airports, high ways, train stations and hotels. <sup>64</sup> These places, or non-places as Augé has titled them, are like human sorting machines in which visitors are transported from one destination to the next, orientating themselves by means of signs, symbols and representations. It is due to their temporal nature and their lack of history, social relations and identity that these ‘spaces between places’ such as high-ways and airports offer little room for social interaction. Instead non-places provide us with an experience of hyper-individuality, hence giving new meaning to Pallasmaa’s definition of ‘architectural autism’: void of tactility and interaction. <sup>65</sup></p>

<p>Now 20 years after the arrival of Augé’s book, we have entered the digital age in which we have extended ourselves, to quote McLuhan, “in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned”. <sup>66</sup> A new type of non-place has come to surface: the Internet. Physical non-places and the virtual realm of the Internet are linked by more than just the fact that they are products of supermodernity. The hegemony of vision has manifested itself online in the shape of attractive imagery and interfaces with icons and symbols to lend a sense of texture to platforms which are essentially intangible. We are lured into clicking around and transporting ourselves from one temporary location to the next through hyperlinks and search engines. Some destinations are fleeting to the extent that they evaporate into the historically void ‘404 – Not Found’ domain, disabling us from revisiting them in time. Rushkoff illustrates how screen-based interaction has come to stand in between us and our existential and embodied experience of the world when he says “we operate solely through our symbol systems, never getting any real feedback from the world. It’s like flying a plane without a visible horizon, depending solely on the information coming from the flight instruments.” <sup>67</sup></p>

<p>Even though fibre-optic cables connect us with what seems to be the rest of the world, this lack of feedback Rushkoff mentions has left online platforms void of social interaction and intimacy. Pariser, whose filter bubble theory was mentioned earlier on in the introduction, explains how the invisible algorithms of our search engines “create a unique universe of information for each of us.” <sup>68</sup> In his book he argues how the personalisation of the Internet not only stimulates individualism as within the non-place, but also limits our ability to learn as it determines the way we encounter ideas and information. This is essentially the problem we are confronted with in our contemporary physical world. With the Internet as an evolved version of the non place, a new type of autism has come into place in and outside the walls of our buildings. Like the filter bubble determining what information reaches us, the shape of our surroundings and digital extensions prohibit us from gaining insight into their invisible structures. As we travers the urban landscape, we are oblivious to the streams of data that our weather sensors, Wi-Fi routers, navigation systems, cell towers and other wireless devices are emitting. In an article from <i>Wired</i> Greenfield says that this makes it “surpassingly hard to be appropriately critical and to make sound choices in a world where we don’t understand the objects around us“. <sup>69</sup> He emphasizes the need for translators to break down the barriers of ubiquitous computing. <sup>70</sup> We are in need of designers who can answer questions about wireless networks such as: what do they look like? Where do they come from? Where are they going? How are they affecting our behaviour and living conditions, but most importantly, how can we use them to their full potential?</p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">LIGHT PAINTING WI-FI</h2>
<p>This is where the same technology which permeates the air with data emissions can be put to use in order to reveal what they inherently hide from us. According to Hansen our smart technologies have brought a new type of sensingto the table. <sup>71</sup> Our devices are subconscious gatherers of data on our whereabouts and behaviour, but also about external forces like the weather and wireless networks which seek to connect with us. “They don’t mediate our senses, they mediate sensibility itself, prior to sensations that we sense with our organs.” <sup>72</sup> How can designers exploit the sensing capabilities of our devices to create the ability for others to experience and interact with these streams of data? How will this change the way we think about the world and ourselves and how will the perception of the invisible data landscape influence the shape of our urban landscapes?</p>

<h4><i>Figure 6. (Left) The probe created by Arnall and Schulze with a LED light and RFID reader. (Right) An RFID field of a ID20 low-frequency EM4102 reader,created with the probe and long exposure photographs.</i></h4>
</div>
</div>

<p>With his <i>Immaterials</i> project Timo Arnall answers directly to Greenfield’s call for designers to come up with solutions for the opacity of the technologies in the networked city. The Danish Interaction Designer and co-founder of Ottica aimed to develop an understanding of our technological devices by means of material exploration and communication with the signals they emit.He asked himself and other designers how “reflective conversations” with ubiquitous computing can be made possible by creating a visual language using photographic, narrative, animated and cinematic techniques. For the past 6 years he has been speculating about the relationship between immaterial phenomena such as radio waves, mobile networks, light, magnetism and the physical space. How can these forces take on a playful, imaginative and physical shape in order for us to interact with them rather than leeching their data for connectivity purposes? <sup>74</sup></p>

<p><i>Immaterials</i> has initiated projects such as <i>Satellite Lamps</i> (see fig. 5) which senses the presence of 24 GPS satellites. The strength of the signals is translated into the alternating brightness of the light revealing how our personal navigation systems are shaped by the spaces in which we are located. <sup>75</sup> <i>The Ghost in the Field</i> is an exploration into the physicality of radio-frequency identification (RFID) used in chip cards. Together with Jack Schulze from BERG studio located in London, Arnall created a probe with an LED light that flashes when it reads an RFID tag. <sup>76, 77</sup> Photographing the movement of the probe around chip cards and electromagnetic readers reveals the spatial properties of RFID fields with multi-dimensional light paintings. Out of all the Immaterial projects though, the <i>Light Painting Wi-Fi</i> project has proven most successful at creating a large scale and insightful view on the invisible Wi-Fi signals which are fundamental to the construction of our networked cities.</p>

<p>For this work Arnall teamed up with Jørn Knutsen and Einar Sneve Martinussen van Voy design studio in Oslo. <sup>78</sup> They built a four-metre long rod with a regular Wi-Fi antenna from a cell phone to measure the Received Signal Strength (RSSI) whilst walking through a field from a particular network. The strip of 80 lights embedded in the Wi-Fi instrument glows according to the strength and acts as a physical strength meter. <sup>79</sup> In order to demonstrate the spatial and material qualities of Wi-Fi, the three went network hunting with the rod through Grünerløkka in Oslo all the while taking long exposure pictures. The series of pictures reveal the strength, scale, shape, fragmentation and quality of the many wireless networks that are spread throughout the city. “The strength, consistency and reach of the network says something about the built environment where it is set up, as well as reflecting the size and status of the host. Small, domestic networks in old apartment buildings flow into the streets in different ways than the networks of large institutions. Dense residential areas have more, but shorter range networks than parks and campuses,” says Martinussen. <sup>80</sup></p>

<div class="image">
<img src="images/image8.jpeg">
<img src="images/image9.jpeg">
<div>
<h4><i>Figure 7. (Left) The outcome long exposure photography whilst walking around Oslo with the Wi-Fi rod. (Right) A close-up of the Wi-Fi rod.</i></h4>
</div>
</div>

<p>In addition to taking a step towards tearing down the borders between man and the imperceptible structures of ubiquitous computing by demystifying what was always a figment of our imagination, Arnall, Martinussen and Knutsen discovered that urban landscapes can be influenced by network infrastructures in the same way that the environment shapes them. While mapping Oslo’s networks they found out that the Wi-Fi signals of the local university extended all the way to a park close by making it a potential working space for students. Analysing a network’s “topography” could create new possibilities for the often inaccessible data structures by “practically and metaphorically connecting different environments”. <sup>81</sup></p>

<p>Through the eyes of Marshall McLuhan’s ‘media as extensions of the body’ theory, the Wi-Fi rod can be acknowledged as tool which enables us to use the products of our technological extensions to their full potential. Thus, new functions for networks in urban environments come into place. Yet despite the magnificent visual outcome it is arguable whether <i>Light Painting Wi-Fi</i> is the “innovation” Greenfield stated in the quote ealier on in this chapter that “compel[s] us [in]to rethink[ing] something so deeply entrenched in culture, and so hard to alter, as the way we make cities.“ <sup>82</sup> If it is not the size of the instrument, than it is the time consuming, co-operate and manual procedure which inhibits the project from being an accessible tool. The photographs solely offer subsequent, static and two-dimensional information concercing the physical networks which have been limited to an area in Oslo as opposed to a real-time service available to all.</p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">THE ARCHITECTURE OF RADIO</h2>

<div class="image">
<img src="images/image11.jpeg">
<div class="image description">
<h4><i>Figure 8. The Architecture of Radio</i></h4>
</div>
</div>

<p>An example of a more dynamic solution for the lack of physicality associated with the Internet, is the iPad application <i>The Architecture of Radio</i> which acts as window onto a parallel reality. The creator Richard Vijgen, a Dutch Information Designer refers to this as the ‘infosphere’ – “[…] an interdependent environment, like a biosphere, that is populated by informational entities.” <sup>83</sup> The application maps the information from an OpenCElllD dataset of over 7 million cell towers and JPL’s Ephemeris data to calculate the overhead position of satellites according to the user’s GPS location. <sup>84</sup> <i>The Architecture of Radio</i> offers those holding the screen in front of them with a real-time, 360-degree, representational data landscape of overlapping communication signals emitting from cell towers, navigational systems and observation satellites in their surroundings. In addition to this, the application has been site-specifically programmed to map the signals of nearby Wi-Fi routers and Ethernet cables at the ZKM Center For Art in Germany which can be viewed until April of this year. <sup>85</sup></p>

</p>Both <i>The Architecture of Radio</i> and <i>Light Painting Wi-Fi</i> succeed at demystifying and translating certain aspects of ubiquitous computing by exploiting the sensing capabilities of our technological extensions in their own separate way. Their outcome however is essentially visual as the one more flowingly than the other translates that what we cannot sense into image. So I ask, in the lightof reintroducing our senses in the ocularcentric digital age, how can the new sensibility of smart technology be implemented in order to synchronize our experiences with technology? In what way can sensuous and embodied communication with computing be stimulated, or as posed by Greenfield: “What would it mean to develop an additional sense which makes us continuously attuned to the invisible data topographies that pervade the city streets?“ <sup>86</sup></p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">PHANTOM TERRAINS</h2>

<p>This is a question which Frank Swain tries to answer with his work <i>Phantom Terrains</i>: a hearing aid with a Wi-Fi sensor which translates wireless frequencies into sound. <sup>87</sup> The London-based author and founder of the blog <i>SciencePunk</i> and writer for <i>New Scientist</i> has been going deaf since the age of 20. In an interview with Tim Chester from <i>Mashable</i> he says he was hesitant though to surrender to the editorialised hearing that came with wearing hearing aids: “I was listening to this computer's vision of what I should hear. <sup>88</sup> Traffic was dampened down, it wasn't really a faithful reproduction of the environment. I thought, 'Why should some engineers in a hearing aid lab decide what I hear.” In stead, he was determined, to transform his disability into a super-ability, albeit in a less invasive and cyborg-like manner than Neil Harbissons’ Eyeborg. <sup>*</sup> Swain partnered up with sound artist Daniel Jones who rewired the writer’s hearing aids to tailor the sound to his content; to hear things other humans were totally deaf: Wi-Fi signals. “If I have to spend my life listening to an interpretative version of the world, what elements could I add? The data that surrounds me seems a good place to start.” <sup>89</sup></p>

<p>What characteristics of sound lend themselves as contributors towards a platform for translating dynamic and continuous data? According to Swain “even more so than our eyes, our ears are adept at gathering and comprehending vast amounts of complex data quickly and easily. <sup>90</sup>”He attributes the failure of the Google Glass to its ocularcentric nature "[…] vision is a very narrow band. You can only focus on one thing at a time” whereas hearing “is fantastically broadband; you can hear 50 conversations in a room, and focus on just one while being aware of others, even if you don't think you're paying attention." <sup>91</sup> In addition to signalling us when we receive something on our phones, sounds are incorporated into our devices for the purpose of providing us with feedback: unlocking our phone is made to sound like we are unlocking a door with a key. During an interview with Roman Mars on <i>99% Invisible’s 15th radio</i> episode ’Sound of the Artificial World’ (2011) sound designer Jim McKee from Earwax Productions says that sound is an important sense in establishing human orientation within the digital world. Physically touching, tapping or stroking something generates sound which confirms our visual and tactile experiences. For this reason the interaction with our electronic devices is accompanied by artificial sounds. McKee explains that without organic feedback derived from real experiences, our inorganic modern appliances would be very hard to use: “If a device and its sounds are designed correctly, it creates a special theatre of the mind that you completely buy into. Electronic things feel mechanical. It’s the feeling of movement, texture, and articulation, where none exists.” <sup>92</sup> These attributes of sound make hearing a great sense for perceiving and comprehending data.</p>

<p><i>Phantom Terrains</i> is Swain’s contribution to a speculative future in which sound enables us to process data and visual interfaces make way for an augmented real-time, sonic interaction with the network routers in our surroundings. In the same way that the <i>Light Painting Wi-Fi</i> rod uses a cell phone’s Wi-Fi sensor, <i>Phantom Terrains</i> is an installation connected to an iPhone which scans the environment for signals. The information is streamed to a hacked Bluetooth hearing aid which translates the name, signal strength, data rate and encryption mode of each network into an orchestra of unique data symphonies. The symbols of a network’s ID is represented by a unique melody along with additional information about the network density. The proximity to the listener is translated into sonic parameters of cracks and clicks. Alltogether this results in a geolocated soundscape mapped to your left or right ear according to the location of the routers merged together with the hearing aid’s regular output. <sup>94</sup></p>

<p><i>Phantom Terrains</i> presents itself as an accessible tool for examining the underlying infrastructures of ubiquitous technology. However, it raises the question whether gaining an understanding of the invisible network forces implies that we must train our bodies to process information. Though one can imagine that many may experience this additional information like the sound scape of the hacked hearing aid as obtrusive. The ability to create sophisticated representations in order express the complexity of our networks is in our midst, yet are tolerant enough to accept an always-on device providing us with an additional sensory layer? According to Swain “only time will tell if we have succeeded in this respect. If we have, it will be a further step towards breaking computers out of the glass-fronted box they have been trapped inside for the last 50 years.” <sup>95</sup> As the air grows thicker with wireless communication <i>Immaterials</i>,<i>The Architecture of Radio</i> and <i>Phantom Terrains</i> all confirm Pallasmaa’s theory that our technologies, which once favoured the eye above the other sensory capacities, can help towards rebalancing the realms of the senses with the sensors of our technological extensions. In the end we might find that the information we obtain from the data landscapes created by the tools designers provide us with may serve to inform the one where the nearest hotspot is, but in Swain’s case he is looking forward to taking his hearing aid to the countryside to see "how far from civilization [he] need[s] to go to escape the smog of Wi-Fi.” <sup>96</sup></p>

<h1 class="chapterTitle">//4. RITUAL SENSING</h1>

<h3 class="chapterUndertitle">“MACHINES THAT FIT THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENT INSTEAD OF FORCING HUMANS TO ENTER THEIRS WILL MAKE USING A COMPUTER AS REFRESHING AS TAKING A WALK IN THE WOODS.” – MARC WISER<sup>97</sup></h3>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">CULTURAL TECHNOLOGY</h2>

<p>In the way that McLuhan appoints electricity in the 20th century as the force which involved humanity in the embrace of the “global village”, the Internet in 21st century has pushed the boundaries of globalisation to the extent that even those without access to basic human needs such as education and running water can be an active member of the “digital global village.” <sup>98, 99</sup> Yet, despite the fact that a vast amount of the world’s population has access to the same technologies and digital platforms, the way we apply and relate to these tools is inherently shaped by our individual needs and the norms and values of our culture. In an article from the Dutch online journal <i>De Correspondent</i>, sinologist Tabitha Speelman explains how, in the eyes of the Chinese, smart phones are practically useless beyond the borders of their own country. <sup>100</sup> The limited access to the World Wide Web laid down by the Chinese authorities has boosted national e-commerce and on-demand services. With an “operating system for life” as technology columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler from The Wall Street Journal describes the revolutionary Chinese messaging service <i>WeChat</i>. <sup>101</sup> As a hosting platform for millions of other apps, <i>WeChat</i> is a new way of transferring money, socializing, ordering a taxi, food or even waiting in line…virtually. It is clear that the Chinese Internet revolution has left the Western man looking slightly archaic.</p>

<p>An even more spectacular technological culture has manifested itself in Japan where crowds go wild at live robot shows and ceremonies are held for irreparable electronic pets. <sup>102</sup> In an episode of the Dutch documentary programme <i>Tegenlicht</i>, <i>De Robots Als Mens</i> (the robot as a human) we join Rob Hattum who travels to Japan in order to witness the country’s extreme robot culture. The director interviews Hiroshi Ishiguro, a Japanese Professor of Robotics at the Osaka University, who is famous for cloning humans including himself in the form of robots, also known as androids. Hattum asks the Professor whether we should be afraid of robots taking over from humanity, but even the plastic surgery the man has undergone to keep up with the artificial, non-aging version of himself fails to hide his astonishment at being asked such a question: “Why do we need to be more special than robots? I don’t understand. Why do you need to differentiate humans from robots? We are humans because we use tools, history shows that we always have.”</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="images/image13.jpeg">
<div class="image description">
<h4><i>Figure 10. Hiroshi Ishiguro (right) with his identical android (left).</i></h4>
</div>
</div>
 
<p>Hattum also speaks with Naho Kitano who is a robot sociologist and the director of Hibot, a company that specializes in industrial snake-like robots which can venture through pipes and other hazardous areas. <sup>103</sup> She explains how Japan as Shintoistic nation believes that every living and non-living object has a soul and that the interaction between a human and robots creates a near spiritual relationship. Her experience with robo-ethics related discussions though, is that Western scientists criticize human-like robots from a Christian perspective; that giving something a soul is giving something life. The Western thought is that recreating life with androids, is like trying to be God.</p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">“FALSE DICHOTOMY”</h2>

<p>Are we trying to be God? It is a question which the Bas Heijne, who was introduced earlier on in chapter, during a series of documental episodes of <i>De Volmaakte Mens</i> (The Perfect Human). He speaks with philosophers and scientists about the ethical dilemmas of the future in which immersive technology, but also DNA manipulation and other transformations of humans by humans enables us to becomes our own creators. He fears that this development is and will continue to be the enemy of what makes us human. According to Hansen, who shared the following words with his audience in Berlin: “the computational revolution is altering the infrastructure of our life world profoundly and thereby changing what it means to be human.” <sup>105</sup> So I ask: what is it that makes us essentially human, and as the lines between man and technology are likely to become entirely erased in the future, what part of being human is at stake?</p>

<p>One of the wisdom speakers Heijne resorts to is the Dutch philosopher Paul Verbeek (1970) who was also introduced in the first chapter of this paper. According to Verbeek we shouldn’t consider humans and technology as two separate entities because, as Ishiguro mentioned as well, it is in our nature to create tools to enhance our lives. Our lack of super instincts and physical capabilities as opposed to the other beings of the animal kingdom has compelled is into creating technologies to bypass these disabilities. It is Verbeek’s philosophical-anthropological opinion that to regard something so inherently natural to us as a threat to what makes us intrinsically human a “false dichotomy” as “our existence hangs from the ropes of technology”. Verbeek campaigns for an “ethics of technological mediation” and speculates about the appropriate ways of introducing technology into society. Rather than fearing the influence they might have on us, we should think about how we can shape their influence. <sup>106</sup> As McLuhan wrote: “we shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us”, but in our contemporary society where a small number of corporations dictate the shape and flow of the consumer industry, the “we” in McLuhan’s statement should rather be replaced by “the industry” or even “the designer of the industry”. <sup>107</sup> Behind each product which is released into society stands a team of designers and engineers who shape our tools and therefore they play a part in shaping us and our surroundings. So it is up to these designers, but also autonomous Product- , Interaction- , Data Designers and artists to find the boundary between determination and freedom when it comes to technology.</p>

<h4><i>Figure 11. Webb’s a touch pad for Separate Togetherness consists of a piezoelectric elements, which detects pressure when it is stroked.</i></h4>
</div>
</div>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">SEPARATE TOGETHERNESS</h2>

<p>Along the path of the preceding chapters ways for designers to humanize our technological experiences have been explored based on the thought that our fear of technology is grounded in our ignorance of the off-screen computational processes. Synchronizing ourselves once again with technology can be accomplished by diluting the mystical air of ubiquitous computing with the reintroduction of non-ocular senses. Could another solution be for designers be to take a stance in manifesting a coherent and harmonious relationship between us and our technological extensions in stead of one that is based on suppression? Can designers establish a paradigm shift in our attitude towards technology by following the Japanese example of literally humanizing our digital experiences by equipping them with genuine human interfaces?</p>

<p>According to Rolston though the goal for designers should be to void from computer-like affordances in order to “help deliver a world where interfaces get out of the way and allow people to live more naturally, spending less time with machines and more on life itself.” <sup>108</sup> Penny Webb’s graduation project for the Design Academy of Eindhoven in The Netherlands is a good example of how our experiences with technology can become human by escaping ”as much as possible from what we perceive as 'technological objects’” as Webb says in an interview with <i>Dezeen Magazine</i>. <sup>109</sup> With <i>Separate Togetherness</i> Webb challenges the notion of the current vision- and audio based communication via the Internet which "on its own,” she says “is a relatively lonely place void of human contact." <sup>110</sup> Webb asked herself how the Internet can be used as a medium for those separated by distance to stay in touch without communicating directly with each other via a screen. How can one engage in a more subconscious and less invasive form of interaction and communication?</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="images/image15.png">
<div class="image description">
<h4><i>Figure 12. Each object is stimulated by a different form of interaction: (f.l.t.r. breathing, stroking and walking by)</i></h4>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus she designed three remote home accessories: a lamp, a mirror and a cloth which are paired with a corresponding ornament at another distant location. With their subtle and gentle appearance the lamp, mirror, textile and their sensoring partners (see fig. 12) not only escape from being perceived as technological devices, they also compliment the architectural environment without drawing too much attention to themselves. According to the designer “the most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.” <sup>111</sup> When subjected to certain stimuli, the sensors embedded in the signalling object of the pair induce a slow and subtle change in the appearance of its receiving partner. This creates a near magical and poetic interaction with whomever may be on the other side. Webb achieves this effect with the use of smart materials such as a copper plate that changes colour in response to someone’s breath. Another example is phosphorescent pigment which glows as a response to changing light and thermochromic pigment which reveals its hidden colours as a reaction to touch. Rather than being an alternative to online communication, Webb describes the objects’ purposeas “simply a way to suggest a presence through your peripheral awareness.” <sup>112</sup> Like the kick of a foetus against the walls of its mother’s stomach.</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="images/image16.jpeg">
<img src="images/image17.jpeg">
<div class="image description">
<h4><i>Figure 13. The cloth has been screen-printed thermochromic pigment which reveals itself in response to the touch pad from figure 11.</i></h4>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even though Webb has succeeded at dismissing pixel based interaction, the communication is established by ways of a visual adjustments in one’s surroundings. This ocular form of interaction can be justified as being less imposing than say a sonic or olfactory output which can signal us from a distance. In this way, the communication is based on timing and coincidence especially considering that one pair accounts for a one-way form of communication. The receiver is not expected to answer the sender’s message as there is a chance he or she may not be at that place at that moment. It is not clear whether Webb intends to establish a two-way ‘separate togetherness’ by installing a sensor and a receiver at both locations. We also remain curious as to whether the sender and the receiver are aware of the whereabouts of the objects at the other location. One can imagine that knowing your partner’s sensor is located in the kitchen or bedroom creates different sensations than knowing when someone goes to the bathroom. It could also be interesting to experiment with the whereabouts of the receiving object; does one feel a different sensation receiving the message while laying in bed? Does it have a different effect when located at say, your work, next to the television or even in a more secluded space like a drawer and if so, do different feelings come into place if both parties are aware or unaware of these locations?</p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">UNTOUCHED</h2>

<p>The content of the message is also determined by the type of sensor: a light sensor sends a signal when someone passes by whereas breathing into and especially stroking an object can trigger different bodily sensations (if the receiver is aware of this interaction). Where <i>The Smell of Design</i> reintroduces the sense of smell in online platforms and <i>Phantom Terrains</i> exploits the sensory capacities of our technology and translates it into something we can hear. <i>Separate Togetherness</i> rather augments a sense by subconsciously extending our largest organ, which during the course of this paper has literally remained untouched: the skin. The touch pad (see fig. 11) has piezoelectric elements which detect pressure and signal this to its partner. In the case of two loved ones separated by a long distance, the touchpad can serve as an extension of the skin and prompt a sense of intimacy through the Internet. However it is questionable whether this interaction, void of the warmth and feel of another’s skin creates the same bodily effect.</p>

<p>To show Hattum that there is no reason to fear robots, Ishiguro invites him to hug one of his androids. Ishiguro believes that human interfaces will become successful in the future as people have the amazing ability to recognize human characteristics. <sup>113</sup> As opposed to our electronic extensions, we are not covered by a hard shell, but rather by a soft surface with over five million nerve endings making the skin the most sensitive of our organs. Michelangelo once said: “To touch can be to give life”; touch is the first sense we develop in the womb and besides from protecting us Pallasmaa writes that the skin is our “first medium of communication.” <sup>114</sup> How can designers stretch beyond the artificial sounds which compliment the tactile interaction with our electronic devices, as McKee explained in the previous chapter, to create a “feeling of movement […] where none exists.” <sup>115</sup> In stead of augmenting touch with sound or a sense of presence like Webb’s <i>Separate Togetherness</i>, how can designers enhance our technological experiences with genuine touch? How can we shape the environment according to our tactile needs? Can the skin act as the mediator to find the balance which Verbeek spoke of between freedom and determination?</p>

<h2 class="paragraphH2">CONDUCTIVE RITUAL</h2>

<p>As we have learnt, creating tools to enhance our lives is in our nature. We are conditioned to live with technology, but according to Rushkoff the multitude of devices we possess in this day and age inhibit us from distinguishing between the two different concepts of time: time in the quantitative sense and being represented by a number (chronos) and time in the qualitative sense (kairos) which is time presented to us in the shape of opportunities and experiences (Carpe diem). <sup>116</sup> He says that in stead of “approaching some Zen state of an infinite moment, completely at one with our surroundings, connected to others, and aware of ourselves on any fundamental level,” we are bombarded with a continuous flow of e-mails, reminders, notifications and unfinished tasks. Rather than being in control of our lives, our devices dictate when we receive data and what data they take from us without asking permission. <sup>117</sup> They live by the rules of chronos and ignore every aspect of kairos and the only filter we have is to turn them off.</p>

<p>How can we prevent our technologies from dictating our rhythms and contribute towards a future in which we can one again live in the now? How we can change the way we use our technologies in order for them to once again become an enhancement in stead of a constant interference? These are questions my fellow Interaction Design students Merel Raven, Juul Koene, Amy Whittle and I sought to answer with our work <i>Conductive Ritual</i>. It is a speculative performance which is aimed at establishing a new relationship between humans and their technological extensions based on symbiosis; where the one cannot live without the other and there is a mutual state of respect in stead of dominance. <sup>118</sup></p>

<p>We were inspired by the Japanese ethics of Rin-ri, which is a belief within robo-ethics that robots and their owner must be in harmony with one another. In het paper ‘Animism, Rinri, Modernization; the Base of Japanese Robotics’ Kitano, the robot sociologist who appeared in the Tegenlight episode, writes: “As far as the owner treats the robot (or the spirit of robot) with proper manner, the robot should have the respect to the owner, act under the harmonization, and have the ethical behaviour.Thus spatially, the togetherness of the existences of the man (the owner) and the robot (the tool) constructs the limit of their betweenness.” <sup>119</sup> If we view this thought in line with Rushkoff’s chronos-and-kairos theory, you could say that our digital tools have lost their respect for us. So we asked ourselves how we as Interaction Designers can use the ethics of Rin-ri to establish a harmonious relationship between us and our technological extensions?</p>

<div class="image description">
<h4><i>Figure 14. The body is transformed into a life-size circuit board by screen printing conductive paint onto the skin.</i></h4>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the 4th episode of <i>De Volmaakte Mens</i>, Heijne interviews David Abbink, a Biomechanical professor at the Technical University of Delft in The Netherlands. He believes that even though we may one day become one with technology, we will never be able to let loose of all control: “If technology comes to fail we are no longer trained to step in on time to save the situation.” <sup>120</sup> According to Abbink it is essential for humans and technology to be able to work together. He is developing a self driving car which is intelligent enough to drive itself as with humans, their performances are not flawless. The car needs the input of the driver to ensure that the trip runs smoothly and communicates with the driver by means of counterforces and vibrations in the steering wheel. “With the touch sensors in my skin and the position-, speed- and force meters in my muscles, I can feel what is taking place in my surroundings.” <sup>121</sup></p>

<p><i>Conductive Ritual</i> combines these two philosophies, the idea that man and technology must respect each other and that they must work together in order for them to function. Thus, we speculated about a future in which our devices become part of our body, but only when we give them permission with a ritual rite of passage. Rituals and technology may seem like two paradoxical realms, but in ‘Rituals in the moderns World – applying the concept of ritual media in ethnography’ by Bent Steeg Larsen and Thomas Tufte we read that “in a sense, ritual and technology are both manifestations of local desires, and they entail complex ordering mechanisms to authorize, verify, and communicate their successful operation. <sup>122</sup> ”Rituals are defined by there their ability to transform ordinary actions into something symbolic: “The media user literally steps out of everyday life into a realm were reality is represented in symbolic form and the momentary suspension relies on a full attention to the content of the media.” <sup>123</sup></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Like the steering wheel of Abbinks self driving car, the interface which mediates between man and technology during the ritual is the skin. The body becomes a life size circuit board of conductive paint which is applied by screenprinting (see fig.15) a pattern onto the arms. These are the sliders which are activated by the conductive rings a person has around his or her finger. When the ring makes contact with the slider, the circuit is closed and activates the piezo element on the arm. To tune into different channels, the ring can be used to slide up and down the arm as it acts as a resistance. The piezo elements work as a speaker and emits a high-pitched sound which means that you are connected.</p>

<p>Compared to our contemporary relationship with technology, one inaugurated by a ritual enables one to live their lives without interruptions and the mediation of screens. During the ritual one can consume information in a more focussed and mindful manner without it being imposing and distractive.</p>

It is supported by a socialaffirmativeness for the new technology. This paper explains how such a social acceptance is made, with the explanation of Japanese Animism, “Rinri (in English, the Ethics)”, and its modernization. These are conditioning Japanese Robotics. In Japan, the traditional rituals are remained strongly in the ordinary life despite of its advanced technology. Paradoxically, it contributes to advance Japanese Robotics; <u>http://www.roboethics.org/icra2007/contributions/KITANO%20Animism%20Rinri%20Modernization%20the%20Base%20of%20Japanese%20Robo.pdf.</u>(Accessed 11/03/2016)</li>

<h1 class="chapterTitle">//CONCLUSION</h1>

<p>Throughout the course of this paper the ways in which technology has determined our behaviour, the shape of our urban landscapes and the way in which we use our senses to perceive and interact with the rest of the world have been explored. By studying the words of Juhani Pallasmaa, Lissa Roberts and Donccha Kavannagh it is clear that our society has preferred the eye above all sensing organs, leading to the suppression of our sense of smell, touch and sound. However, we can conclude together with of thoughts and theories of Mark Hansen, Mark Rolston and Adam Greenfield that the ocularcentric paradigm of modern society has failed to manifest itself as a contributor towards demystifying the hidden structures of our networked cities. Not only is our existential experience of the world through our senses being dictated by society, we are oblivious to the streams of data which are emitted by the multitude of wireless electronic devices. We are blind citizens in an ocularcentric society. However, the fact that our manoeuvres are mediated through our extensions, does not mean we are defenseless. We have learnt from Peter Paul Verbeek that we must find the boundary between freedom and determination in our relationship with technology; to fly exactly between the sun and the sea in order for our wings not to melt and send us crashing into the earth.</p>

<p>Along the path of the preceding chapters ways of humanizing our technological experiences were explored based on the thought that the fear of technology is grounded in our ignorance towards the off-screen computational processes. In order to define the role of the designer in humanizing these experiences with technology, the following two questions were asked:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can designers contribute towards a world in which the ocular bias makes way for olfactory, sonic, aromatic and tactile sensing?</li>
<li>With what methods can designers demystify and reveal the hidden processes of ubiquitous computing in our urban landscapes?</li> 
</ul>

<p>By asking these questions I aimed to find different solutions for humanizing, embracing and changing our attitude towards technology. In conclusion it can be said that preventing the further suppression of our non-ocular senses can go hand in hand with revealing the imperceptible network structures of ubiquitous computing with the following methods:</p> 

<ul>
<li>By re-introducing bodily sensing in the interaction between humans and their technological extensions, like in <i>The Smell of Data</i></li>
<li>By exploiting the sensing provided by smart technology, like with <i>Phantom Terrains</i>.</li>
<li>By voiding from computer-like affordances, like <i>Separate Togetherness</i>.</li>
<li>By mindfully inviting technology into our lives by means of a ritual, as with <i>Conductive Ritual</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>By exploiting one or more of these methods, our non-ocular senses can establish a meaningful interaction between man and his technology and enhance our existential experience of our surroundings by diluting the mystical air of ubiquitous computing. In order for us to safeguard humanity, the goal for designers must be to respect what makes us essentially human.</p>
